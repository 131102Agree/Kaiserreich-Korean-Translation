GER_doctrine_new:0 "군제 개혁"
GER_doctrine_new_desc:0 "한스 폰 젝트의 죽음과 아우구스트 폰 막켄젠의 은퇴 이후, 총참모장은 독일군의 전술적 기초, 즉 교리로서 사용해야 하는 방안은 무엇인가에 대한 끊임없는 토론에 몰두해왔습니다."
GER_doctrine_great_war:0 "분대 전술"
GER_doctrine_great_war_desc:0 "무질서한 중국 내전에 대한 개입이 우리에게 가르쳐 준 하나는 직접 대면한 수준에서 보병간 협동을 높게 평가할 수는 없다는 점입니다. 그렇지만 현재 우리 장병에게 그루펜타틱켄(Gruppentaktiken), 즉 집단 전술이 교육되고 있기 때문에, 장병들은 부적합한 장비만을 통탄할 뿐입니다..."

GER_doctrine_great_war_2:0 "현대 전술"
GER_doctrine_great_war_2_desc:0 "여기 제국군의 장교가 되고자 하는 사람이라면 누구나 읽고자 하는 책 한 권이 있다 - 클라우제비츠' '손자병법'. 최고의 군사 이론가들에게 그 주제에 대해서 논의하게 한다면, 그들은 수 세기는 더 된 이 책에서부터 현대전의 요건에 적용할 수 있는 원리를 채택할 것이다."
GER_doctrine_mobile:0 "차량화 침투"
GER_doctrine_mobile_desc:0 "우리 군 고위 지휘부는 여러 사안에 대해 하나된 의견을 도출하지 못하였으나, 하나의 사안에는 의견을 모으고 있습니다: 1870년과 1871년 승리를 되돌아봤을 때, 작전 규모에서 신속하고 결정적인 승리는 보병을 집단적으로 차량화함으로써 달성할 수 있다는 것입니다."
GER_doctrine_mobile_2:0 "새로운 교리"
GER_doctrine_mobile_2_desc:0 "군 고위 지휘부의 하인츠 폰 구데리안과 에리히 폰 만슈타인 등과 같은 급직전인 혁신가의 일부는 완전히 새로운 교리에 대한 연구를 도입하기 위해 영향력을 행사하고 있습니다. 견고한 전선을 돌파하기 위해 기갑 선봉대의 신속한 기동에 초점을 맞추고자 합니다."
GER_doctrine_mobile_3:0 "전차 생산공장에 투자"
GER_doctrine_mobile_3_desc:0 "적지만 직접적인 투자를 통해 전차 생산공장의 생산량을 향상할 수 있습니다. 다만 보수적인 장군의 일부는 이 투자에 동의하지 않을 것입니다."

GER_mil_expansion_naval_1_desc:0 "카이저리헤 마리네(Kaiserliche Marine), 황제 해군은 지구상 어느 바다에서도 무적입니다. 지금으로는 브리튼 연방, 프랑스, 미국, 일본 모두 이를 시샘하며 우리를 뛰어넘으려고 합니다. 하지만 이를 내버려 둔다면, 우리는 해상 지배력은 다하고 말 것입니다. 1934년에 시작한 해군 근대화 계획을 계속해야 합니다."
GER_global1:0 "싱가포르 보급로"
GER_global1_desc:0 "세계 제국의 보유에는 바다를 넘어 지배력을 행사해야 한다는 작은 단점이 있습니다. 이 문제는 우리가 병사뿐만이 아니라 세금 징수관과 여타 해충을 내보내야 한다는 것을 의미합니다. 거기에 세금 징수 양식 또한 필요하며, 이 모든 것은 독일로부터의 머나먼 길을 거쳐 보내져야 합니다. 그렇기 때문에 준비가 필요합니다. "
GER_global2:0 "싱가포르 항구 확장"
GER_global2_desc:0 "이제 우리가 세금 징수 양식을 보낼 능력을 가지고 있으니, 그에 맞춘 수용력을 가진 항구가 필요합니다. 싱가포르 항구는 AOG로 향하는 독일 선박, 델리행 오스트랄라시아 선박, 그리고 때때로 미국이나 러시아의 선박으로 붐비는 동반구에서 가장 바쁜 곳입니다. 무역은 번성합니다. 이에 우리는 항구를 확장해야 합니다.."
GER_global3:0 "하와이와 조약"
GER_global3_desc:0 "현재 싱가포르는 우리의 극동 항구이며, 태평양은 광대합니다. 우리는 타격하고자 하는 미국 서쪽 해안 어느 곳이든 들어가야 하지 않을까요? 더 가까운 기지가 필요합니다. 그렇다면 한 곳이 특히 유망합니다. 바로 하와이의 독립된 섬입니다. 정박권을 요청하기 하와이 정부에 접근해야 합니다. "

GER_mil_expansion_desc:0 "We have won our place in the sun, but if we want to keep it, we must make sure our army is second to none. Let us invest in military research and expansion."
GER_Luftwaffe_fighter:0 "전투기 중점"

GER_Luftwaffe_airbases_1:0 "더 많은 공군기지 건설"
GER_Luftwaffe_airbases_1_desc:0 "Build airbases both in the Heimat and outer provinces so that we can set the infrastructure for better defence and offence in the skies."
GER_Henschel_Albatros:0 "해군 항공대"
GER_Henschel_Albatros_desc:0 "Another result of the untangling of air warfare from ground warfare has been the founding of a group of aviators focused on naval aviation. These pilots, trained in special courses, are now demanding aircraft to fit their special requirements."
GER_Junkers_Fogger:0 "장거리 전투기"
GER_Junkers_Fogger_desc:0 "As a result of the Bombergruppen doctrine, the demands on range of operations has multiplied. Theorists and researchers are demanding new aircraft models to keep up with their increasingly aggressive bombardment plans. After the Paris bomber comes the London bomber, after that the Moscow bomber - and there doesn't seem to be an end!"
GER_air_doc:0 "세계 대전의 교훈"

GER_mil_expansion_land_1:0 "군국주의 부활"
GER_mil_expansion_land_1_desc:0 "After our victory in the Weltkrieg, the German people grew tired of war and conquest and are feeling content with our power. It is time for us to revive the militaristic spirit of the German people, in the name of the Reich and the Kaiser!"
GER_Infantry_divs:0 "신무기"

GER_political_1:0 "제국 개혁"
GER_political_1_desc:0 "While it is undeniable the German empire is the greatest nation to ever grace the pages of history, there is always room for improvement. In light of recent 'shortcomings' of our policies we should look into various changes and reforms we can make for a better future."
GER_black_monday_aftermath:0 "검은 월요일의 후유증"
GER_black_monday_aftermath_desc:0 "The great stock market crash of 1936, widely known as 'Black Monday', has already had a massive impact on German politics, culture, and society. While the damage might never be fixed, we should enact reforms and recovery policies to regain some of our lost capacity."
GER_mil_industry_2:0 "PEkI I"
GER_mil_industry_2_desc:0 "Black Monday has hit the civilian industry horribly, and the military industry has been affected even worse. Our military supply specialists are clamouring for a program for the extension of war-relevant industries, or Programm fur die Erweiterung kriegswichtiger Industrien, to ensure our military has bullets to fight."
GER_mil_industry_3:0 "PEkI II"
GER_mil_industry_3_desc:0 "The Programm fur die Erweiterung kriegswichtiger Industrien - or abbreviated PEkI, but who would want to abbreviate such a good, German word - is making progress. At least our arsenals don't have to open their last reserves whenever a unit wants to move out anymore. There's still some way to go, but at least we are on the right path."
GER_civ_industry_1:0 "ZIP I"
GER_civ_industry_1_desc:0 "Our heavy industry is in shambles, with many workers out of a job after their former employers were forced to submit to the crisis. Some of our leading economy researchers have proposed a plan for civil industrilisation, the Zivilindustrialisierungsplan, to revitalise the civilian industrial sector."
GER_civ_industry_2:0 "ZIP II"
GER_civ_industry_2_desc:0 "The first phase of the Zivilindustrialisierungsplan has shown promise, but there is more yet to come. At least some of the worst social and economic disaster has been alleviated, though."
GER_civ_industry_3:0 "ZIP III"
GER_civ_industry_3_desc:0 "With our civilian industry once again strong, but not yet booming, we are required to take just a few more steps. Soon enough German industry will tower above the rest of the world once more, as the steady influx of resources from the colonies assures a massive production boost."
GER_industry_finished:0 "경기 활성"
GER_industry_finished_desc:0 "With our economic policies following the Black Monday a resounding success, private investors have picked up on the lead, and the economy has not only stabilised, but is currently experiencing a boom of sorts. It won't hold forever, but for the minute, we can concentrate on other issues."
GER_economy:0 "경제 상태"
GER_economy_desc:0 "It's good, really. The industry is humming along, the grain is coming in from the eastern member states of Mitteleuropa, many citizens have work. It's looking up for the Kaiserreich, and it seems like nothing will be able to stop the golden age of the late Reichskanzler Tirpitz..."
GER_research_expansion:0 "추가 연구 기금"
GER_research_expansion_desc:0 "Investing in science and technology to stimulate advances in both military and civilian affairs. Isn't that an awfully good phrase? Doesn't really say anything, but it sure sounds good. Anyway, the laboratories are over there..."
GER_ig_farben:0 "IG 파르펜 투자"
GER_ig_farben_desc:0 "We can invest in IG Farben, a pharmaceuticals company currently researching ways to synthesise various chemical compounds that might prove useful to our interests."
GER_krupp:0 "프리드리히 크루프 AG 독점"
GER_krupp_desc: "The Krupp dynasty is an almost 400-year-old Dynasty of Industrious Germans, who has fed the German war machine ever since the Thirty Years' War! It is time we put them in state employment again, as their talents will be badly needed with a new Weltkrieg on the horizon."
GER_artillery_research:0 "포 연구"
GER_artillery_research_desc:0 "An area in which the German army has a long and standing tradition of lagging behind is the area of light support artillery. While the successes in building huge, unwieldy and impractical prestige objects such as the 'Paris Gun' can't be doubted, it's time to invest in some of the more practical - and more efficient - alternatives."
GER_doctrine_armor:0 "장갑 돌파"
GER_doctrine_armor_desc:0 "Another crucial point of Guderians and Mansteins new doctrine is the so-called Schwerpunkt. They believe that Panzer technology has advanced to a point where amassed, mobile Panzer forces, with adequately equipped support troops, should be able to lead any offensive to victory. Now they need new Panzers to fit this idea."
GER_hahn_meitner:0 "아인슈타인 & 마이트너 지원"
GER_hahn_meitner_desc:0 "Herr Einstein and Fraulein Meitner are both extremely talented physicists; Einstein is regularly published in science journals even in the Syndicalist bloc, and Meitner is a department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute! Together, we believe, the two can help create extremely powerful tools for society. And even more powerful weapons."
GER_rocket:0 "폰 브라운 지원"

GER_kaiser_wilhelm_society_desc:0 "Recent investments in the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science have resulted in greater research capacity in various fields.

GER_black_monday_radio:0 "재상과 라디오"
GER_black_monday_radio_desc:0 "The crisis has shaken the Germans' belief in their country. Reichskanzler von Papen hopes to turn the tide with weekly radio addresses in which he will announce what steps the government has taken to combat the crisis."
GER_groener1:0 "수익성이 없는 재산 청산"
GER_groener1_desc:0 "The statesman Wilhelm Groener has recently published an essay titled 'The black zero: the need for austerity', in which he demands absolute balance discipline, even if it means losing some companies depending on subsidies. The essay has found a lot of adherents within the populace, as we have been forced to cut most funding for social agencies already anyway."
GER_groener2:0 "제국 노동 봉사단"
GER_groener2_desc:0 "The contacts and friends of Groener among military circles have now proposed a radical innovation: For the duration of the crisis, recruits will be able to choose to fulfil half a year of military service as manual labourers in state service instead. While bad for recruitment numbers, this will inject some needed lobar into our economy."
GER_groener3:0 "실론 매각"
GER_groener3_desc:0 "The island of Ceylon is a very unprofitable part of our colonial empire, requiring massive investment every year. However, there have been proposals of selling the island to the Princely Federation - without doubt a profitable idea."

GER_schacht1_desc:0 "The president of the Reichsbank, Hjalmar Schacht, demands to be given green light to go ahead with his economic program, dubbed the 'Schachtplan': According to him, we need to bail out the highly indebted Junker estates if we don't want to trigger an even further descent into chaos."
GER_schacht2:0 "투자 계획"
GER_schacht2_desc:0 "The next part of the Schachtplan would be a massive program aiming to encourage private investion, both into businesses as into consumer products. While this will be hard to achieve, it should enable producers to find a market for their products again, which will hopefully restart the economy."
GER_schacht3:0 "폴란드 접근"
GER_schacht3_desc:0 "With the economy slowly finding its track again, the time has maybe come to finally include Poland into the customs-free zone formed by Mitteleuropa. There has been some enthusiasm about this proposal in some circles; Especially the Zentrum politician Heinrich von Brentano has been a leading proposer of the idea."
GER_mitteleuropa:0 "중부 유럽 단일 통화"
GER_mitteleuropa_desc:0 "Now that Heinrich von Brentano and his friends of the European Friendship association have found their way into upper government circles, he has proposed another of his ideas: A common currency, shared by all Mitteleuropean countries. This would, of course, never work. European friendship? What a silly idea."
GER_synthetic:0 "합성 화학 연구"
GER_synthetic_desc:0 "The IG Farben researchers have, in cooperation with members ofthe Kaiser Wilhelm society, been able to make astounding breakthroughs on the area of synthetic production already. By giving them access to some more funds, we might be able to make their research ready for mass implementation."
GER_experimental_research:0 "실험적 연구"
GER_experimental_research_desc:0 "While we have already made good progress in some of the more traditional fields relevant to industry - engineering, chemistry, physics - some of our scientists want funding to conduct research into some more esoteric matters. Profit might not be as immediate as so far, but the potential is immense!"
GER_black_monday_finish:0 "검은 월요일 개혁 종결"
GER_black_monday_finish_desc:0 "It seemed impossible, but the numbers confirm it; The crisis is nearing its end. Nearing its end, that is. There are still millions without jobs, and civil society has been stretched to its very end. The catastrophe of Black Monday will leave marks for a long time, but this is the beginning of the end."
GER_pathfinders:0 "유소년 조직화"
GER_pathfinders_desc:0 "Some experts have suggested that the best solution against the current lawlessness in our nations youth would be organising them so that they can learn new skills and use their energies for the public good. The Pfadfinder organisation would require increased spending for such an endeavour."
GER_dcgb:0 "기독교 노동조합"
GER_dcgb_desc:0 "By founding the Deutscher Christlicher Gewerkschaftsbund as a state-endorsed union, we will hopefully establish a bulwark against attacks on the workers' loyalty from left and right. Workers will be able to voice their concerns under the moral authority of priests and the guiding hand of the 'summus episcopus'; The Kaiser."
GER_jet:0 "항공 추종"
GER_jet_desc:0 "The image of the aviator has changed in the current conflict. They have replaced the cavalry as the image of the glorious and gallant war; Every child aspires to be an aviator and streak across the skies in his shining armour. By further fostering this image, we can motivate our pilots to give their very best in the service of the Reich."
GER_linie1:0 "루덴도르프 선 복구"
GER_linie1_desc:0 "The Syndicalist menace looms darker than ever. In fear of going into the next war unprepared, the reactivation of the old Ludendorfflinie has been considered. Once one of the dictators many costly prestige projects, the line of bunkers and fortifications has fallen into disuse the last years - but that's nothing that can't be solved with a bit of engineering ingenuity!"
GER_linie2_full:0 "뫼즈 강을 너머 저 멀리"
GER_linie2_full_desc:0 "Our puppet regime in Brussel is screaming for help against the Syndicalists. Extending the reactivation of the Ludendorfflinie over the Meuse river, up to the North Sea coast, would be costly and take lots of precious time - but it might enable us to make a stand somewhere that isn't Germany."
GER_linie2_small:0 "바스토뉴만을 현대화"
GER_linie2_small_desc:0 "Our resources are stretched thin and time is of the essence. Even though Flanders-Wallonia may lie somewhat under-defended, we can't afford to waste time defending something that will be lost sooner or later anyway."
GER_linie3:0 "라인란트 요새화"
GER_linie3_desc:0 "The Rhineland is the most heavily industrialised region in the entire world and vital to our economy, both in peace as in war. And yet, it lies only a few miles away from a border many have been eyeing nervously the last few weeks. In order to prepare against any eventualities, we should start extending the Ludendorflinie northwards."
GER_schule:0 "파데르본 공군 학교"
GER_schule_desc:0 "The establishment of a formalised school for our aviators would help immensely in unifying and promoting this currently somewhat disorganised field. There are a lot of heroes of air warfare from the Weltkrieg, the most famous of course being the Red Baron himself, whose insight can still be valuable to new recruits; There, they could teach what they know."
GER_institut:0 "항공 공학 연구원"
GER_institut_desc:0 "An independent research organisation for aviation technology, the Institut fur Luftfahrttechnik, could prove a major stepping stone on the way to ensuring German dominance not only on the ground and on the sea, but also in the skies."
GER_heerflieger:0 "플리거트루페 유지"
GER_heerflieger_desc:0 "Our aviators are currently organised as parts of our army structure, without an independent air force command. This boosts cooperation between aviators and ground troops, and therefore leads to the current doctrine concentrating on just that; air support with ground force primacy. This is good and should stay that way."
GER_luftwaffe:0 "루프트바페 설립"
GER_luftwaffe_desc:0 "The Red Baron, Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen, has since the Weltkrieg been arguing for the establishment of an independent air force - the Luftwaffe, as he likes to call it. Up to very recently, the conservative elements in the traditionally more prestigious ground forces have been able to prohibit this, but with war looming once again, it might be time to consider the Baron's idea."
GER_sturzflieger:0 "슈투츠플리거"
GER_sturzflieger_desc:0 "One concept that has recently found a lot of supporters among aviation researchers is that of an aircraft that dives from great heights onto the battlefield to deliver its payload, using its momentum to climb again immediately afterwards. This concept, dubbed Sturzflieger, would minimise the time our precious aircraft would be in immediate danger."
GER_cas:0 "근접 항공 지원 편성"
GER_cas_desc:0 "The requirements and possible uses of close air support aircraft have proven to be far different from those of more main-stream fighter aircraft. If we concentrate or air research capabilities on identifying and exploiting these little intricacies of this specialised from of air warfare, we should be able to achieve far better results in aircraft manufacturing."

gerdom.1.d:0 "After the crushing defeat of the Second French Empire by forces of the North German Federation, our constitution was signed in 1871 by representatives of the North German Federation and of four Southern German states. This constitution put the Southern German states under the influence of the North German Federation, thus giving the enlarged entity a new identity as the Deutsches Reich. \n\nAccording to the constitution, the empire was a federation of 25 German states. The Bundesprasidium was held by the King of Prussia, who had the title of German Emperor. The Emperor appointed the Chancellor, the head of government and chairman of the Bundesrat, the council of representatives of the German states. Laws were enacted by the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, the Imperial Diet elected by male Germans above the age of 25 years. \n\nHowever, it is the Emperor, not the Bundesrat or the Reichstag, who leads the power in the German Empire. With an option to dissolve the Reichstag on a whim, it is clear that the main political power in the German Empire rests not in Reichstag, elected by the people, but in the hands of the non-elected German Emperor. Another issue is the Prussian three-class voting system, which has remained unchanged since 1849. \n\nOver sixty years after the founding of the Kaiserreich, the liberals and social democrats are growing increasingly disgruntled with this status of things and our constitution may see large revisions in the next few years..."

Now their wishes have finally come true, as state of war exist between our glorious Vaterland and the nest of syndicalist vipers. After Kaiser Wilhelm II explained in a special radio address reasons for Germany's involvement in another war with France and called for eradication of final obstacle to achieving "A Place in the Sun" thousands of young Germans rushed to enlist in the military, following the example of Kaiser's grandsons, and civilians began gathering on streets manifesting their support for war.

Die Gartenlaube, one of the newspapers owned by the DVLP chairman Alfred Hugenberg, reported that two daughters of Freiherr Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, general and friend of influential Reichskriegsminister von Schleicher, were involved in shady dealings with syndicalist intelligence. Shortly afterwards, the Reichstag member Franz Seldte fanned the flames by asking why the Abwehr, run by von Schleicher's friend Ferdinand von Bredow, was not able to find out that the family of an associate of the state secretary on war was infiltrated by hostile intelligence. While general von Hammerstein-Equord resigned and publicly apologised for his daughter's doings, the real question for von Schleicher was - should he pull strings to replace von Bredow and remove any further threats to his political career from that direction, and if yes - by whom?"

Every bell proudly proclaims this day of celebration. Nobility, soldiers and unnumbered veterans parade proudly through the streets, cheered by the happy masses.

On one hand he was a hero of the Weltkrieg, the orchestrator of German victory in 1919. On the other hand, most Germans haven't forgotten his ensuing military dictatorship, that only ended when Admiral Von Tirpitz forced him to retire after the infamous Osthilfeskandal in 1924. Although Ludendorff still received some honours for his service, like his knighthood, the former quartermaster-general mostly led a secluded life at his estate afterwards."

And while the Reich enjoyed prosperity under his reign, he also continued o hold off on fulfilling the Kaiser's Easter Promises from 1917, leaving us with some troubles in the past years. \n\nStill, his prestige is enormous, and the anniversary of his death has been accompanied by public demonstrations of respect all across the Empire."

Notable examples include the diary of Sergant Adolf Hitler, a signalman who amongst other distinctions was awarded no less than two Iron Crosses for his valour on the Western and Eastern fronts. \n\nThe diaries provide a unique and fiery insight into the nature of the bitter ideological struggle.

'Unser Kampf' boasts the highest production values hitherto seen - made possible by state investments into the Babelsberg studios - and offers a frighteningly real depiction of the war. Starring Heinz Ruhmann, Hans Albers and Theodor Loos, the story focuses on the heroism and dedication of the 'small people' in the Weltkrieg, such as the valiant corporal Adolf Hitler, who sacrificed everything for his Kaiser and the Reich."
