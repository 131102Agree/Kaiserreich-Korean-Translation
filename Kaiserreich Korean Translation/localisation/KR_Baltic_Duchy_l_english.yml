balticduchy.1.d:0 "데어 오스트리히 슈츠발 데스 카이저라이히스, 발트 연합 공국은 이러한 이름으로 알려져 있습니다. 독일 제국의 작은 위성국인 이 나라에서, 정치 권력의 모든 스펙트럼은 리가, 레벨, 오셀 섬과 다고 섬에 거주하는 소수 독일인들에게 집중되어 있습니다. 이 나라의 나머지 인구는 주로 라트비아인과 에스토니아인입니다."
balticduchy.1.a:0 "흥미롭네요, 더 알려주세요!"

balticduchy.2.d:0 "행정적으로, 공국은 두개의 도시, 리가와 레벨과 네 개의 주, 오셀란드, 에스틀란트, 리블란트와 쿠를란트로 나눠집니다. 국가는 매우 중앙집권화되어 있으며, 지방은 권력이 거의 없습니다. 게다가, 지방의 에스토니아인, 라트비아인과의 최근 긴장으로 인해 리블란트와 에스틀란트에 두 개의 특수 보안 사령부가 세워졌습니다."
balticduchy.2.a:0 "Just what have I gotten myself into?"

balticduchy.3.t:0 "공국의 전반적인 상황"
balticduchy.3.d:0 "이 작은 공국은 완전히 안정적이지는 앖습니다. 리투아니아는 바다로의 출구를, 러시아는 발트 지방을 가지기를 원하며 핀란드는 범핀란드-우구리아 계획을 가지고 있습니다. 게다가 에스틀란트, 리블란트, 쿠를란트에 온전히 힘이 미치지 못하는 것은 경제에 심각하게 방해가 될 것입니다. 여러 내부 문제는 말할 것도 없습니다. 이러한 문제들은 향후 계획이 수립되기 전에 해결되어야 합니다."
balticduchy.3.a:0 "다음 게임에서는 스위스를 해야 겠군."

balticduchy.5.a:0 "보수당이지!"
balticduchy.5.b:0 "독일인 민족당이지!"

balticduchy.6.t:0 "발트 연방의 탄생"
balticduchy.6.d:0 "오늘, 발트 연합 공국의 정부는 이 험한 세계에서 살아남으려면 오직 함께해야 한다고 선언했습니다. 구 정부는 이 나라를 통치하는데 무능력하다는 것을 보여 주었으며, 아돌프 공작와 그의 지지자들은 새로운 정부가 선출될 때까지 있을 임시 정부를 구성했습니다. 연방 만세!"
balticduchy.6.a:0 "우리는 단결한다!"

balticduchy.8.t:0 "급진좌파가 정권을 장악하다"
balticduchy.8.d:0 "빨갱이들의 지원을 받은 급진파가 공공연하게 반란을 일으켰습니다. 공작 자신과 내각 대부분이 붙잡혔습니다. 연방 의회의 꼭대기에서는 이제 적기가 펄럭이고 있습니다. 이젠 선택할 시간입니다. 새로운 발트 연방을 이끌 동무들은 누구일까요?"

balticduchy.29.d:0 "불경기가 임박함에 따라, 대부분 도시에 있는 독일인과 지방에 있는 비독일인들 간의 오랜 불화가 점점 더 심해지고 있습니다. 어떤 이들은 독일인들이 이 땅에 정착하도록 장려해야 한다고 제안했으며, 또 어떤 이들은 지방 사람들을 정치 생활에 완전히 통합시키는 것을 원합니다. 결국, 이는 제국에 완전히 통합되는가, 아니면 제국의 권위에서 부분적으로 벗어나는 가에 대한 선택입니다."

balticduchy.30.d:0 "거의 2주 전, 베를린 증권 거래소는 끝이 보이지 않게 추락을 했으며, 독일 경제는 전례 없는 위기에 빠졌습니다. 이제 이 폭락의 여파가 발트 연합 공국에 까지 도달했습니다. 독일인 소유의 회사들이 노동자들을 일시 해고하거나 문을 닫았고, 파피어마르크의 가치는 떨어지며, 농산물 수출은 줄어들고 있습니다..."
balticduchy.30.a:0 "정부가 우리를 최악으로부터 벗어나게 해주기를 바라자..."

balticduchy.50.d:0 "개혁이 진행됨에 따라, 일부 장군들은 '원주민'이나 라트비아어와 에스토니아어를 쓸 수 있는 자를 신병으로 모집하고 싶어합니다. 전쟁 장관은 그들 중 누구도 하급 장교 이상이 될 수 없다고 말했습니다."

balticduchy.51.d:0 "비관론자들의 예상대로, 라트비아인 부대 중 하나에서 반란이 시작되었고, 이제는 거의 모든 비독일 및 비에스토니아 부대를 위협하고 있습니다. 대부분의 반란자들은 일반 군인들에게 더 많은 자유, 더 나은 음식, 더 많은 급료를 주기를 원하지만, 급진파는 '사악한 독일 정권을 전복하자'라고 말하고 있습니다. 우리가 대다수의 반란자들을 이길 수는 있지만 협상이 필요할 것입니다."
balticduchy.51.a:0 "협상을 시작하라"
balticduchy.51.b:0 "그들은 아무것도 받을 자격이 없다!"

balticduchy.70.d:0 "전 지역을 독일 제국에 통합하는 걸 가속화하기 위한 우리 독일 종주국의 결정은 현지 라트비아인과 에스토니아인의 강한 반발에 부딪쳤습니다. 여러 급진 민족주의 단체들이 양국을 망칠 의도로 독일 정착민들의 파도에 맞서 싸우기 시작했습니다. 그들의 목표는 독일 제국으로부터 완전히 자유롭게 되는 것입니다."
balticduchy.70.a:0 "걱정해야 할 일인가?"

balticduchy.71.t:0 "친러시아 운동의 주장!"
balticduchy.71.d:0 "전 지역을 독일 제국에 통합하는 걸 가속화하기 위한 우리 독일 종주국의 결정은 큰 불만을 품고 범러시아 운동에 참가한 라트비아인과 에스토니아인들이 오랫동안 탄압받은 소수 러시아인들과 함께 하도록 했습니다. 그들의 목표는 국가를 가능한 한 러시아와 함께 하도록 하는 것입니다."

balticduchy.72.t:0 "민족주의자와 친러시아 운동이 연합하다"
balticduchy.72.d:0 "중대한 사안입니다. 우리의 급진적인 친독일 정책을 이유로 민족주의 라트비아와 에스토니아 운동과 친러시아 운동이 발트를 독일의 압제로부터 해방하고 자유 발트국을 세우기 위해 연합한 것 같습니다. 새로운 민족주의 운동 연합의 이름은 소유즈 오스보보즈데니야 프리발틱 (발트국 해방 연합) - SOP 이며 이는 우리 국가를 크게 위협하고 있습니다."

balticduchy.80.t:0 "SOP의 쿠데타!"
balticduchy.80.d:0 "Our large nationalist SOP movement has decided to step up its operations in order to gain control over our state. They even managed to get part of our armed forces on their side and with their help the pro-Russian nationalists entered our capital.

balticduchy.85.t:0 "Reintroduction of the Russian legislature"
balticduchy.85.d:0 "Russia was forced to reevaluate its stance towards our autonomous status. In preparation for the direct reintegration of our state into Russia we were forced to gradually integrate Russian legislature into our legislative system."

BAT_Germanization_desc:0 "Almost two decades have passed since we achieved our status as a German protectorate. These decades have turned our nation into a German-dominated state, and we must respect their wishes. The Kaiser calls for Germanisation, and we shall follow suit. Drang Nach Osten!"

BAT_Emancipation:0 "해방"
BAT_Emancipation_desc:0 "Almost two decades have passed since we achieved our status as a German protectorate. The Germans dominate our industry, our politics, and our military. We may be Germans too, but the Vaterland is growing weak, it is perhaps our chance to break those ties."

BAT_Ger_Kurland1:0 "쿠를란트 식민화"
BAT_Ger_Kurland1_desc:0 "Kurland, or Kursas as the locals call it, shall be the first step towards the full Germanisation of our Duchy. It will be easy to turn this region into a German-dominated one, despite some native resistance."

BAT_Ger_Livland1:0 "리블란트 식민화"
BAT_Ger_Livland1_desc:0 "Livland, referred to by the locals as Latgale, is the heart of our very Duchy, and yet the countryside of this region is still mostly Latvian. Hopefully, not for long."

BAT_Ger_Estland1:0 "에스틀란트 식민화"
BAT_Ger_Estland1_desc:0 "Estland, or Estonia according to the locals, is the final step towards the full Germanisation of our Duchy. We already have experience in strategic immigrant settling and fighting local language usage, so this will be an easy task."

BAT_Ger_Kurland2:0 "독일령 쿠를란트"
BAT_Ger_Kurland2_desc:0 "The Germanisation project has yielded exactly the results we needed. The percentage of Germans in Kurland is growing every day, and despite native resistance, the ideal of Drang nach Osten grows stronger every day."

BAT_Ger_Livland2:0 "독일령 리블란트"

BAT_Ger_Integration_desc:0 "The Vaterland calls! We are Germans, and our Duchy shall become the 29th Imperial State! A glorious future awaits us under the full protection and oversight of the German Vaterland."

BAT_Ger_Puppet_desc:0 "Reuniting with the Vaterland is important, but not the top priority. While we may be Germans, we are Baltic Germans, and we must receive special treatment. Reunification can wait, we must deal with local matters first."

BAT_Ger_Indep:0 "독립"
BAT_Ger_Indep_desc:0 "The valley between Vaterland Germans and Baltic Germans will never, and we do mean never, be treaded over by the Empire. We, the Germans of Livland, Kurland and Estland, must cease all dealings with the mainland, and declare independence!"

BAT_Ger_Autonomy1:0 "독일인 자치권"
BAT_Ger_Autonomy1_desc:0 "It is time for us to reform. The conservatives within the Baltic Landtag want to turn the nation into a parliamentary monarchy and abandon the nigh-absolutist practices of Adolf Friedrich I. Should we listen?"

BAT_Ger_Autonomy2:0 "카이저와 대면하다"
BAT_Ger_Autonomy2_desc:0 "The Vaterland is disappointed. To them, a strong parliamentary Baltic Duchy means a more autonomous and resistant Baltic Duchy. Our relations with the Kaiser have been damaged. It is time we finally confront the Kaiser about our increased political autonomy instead of leaving the resolution of this conflict to chance."

BAT_Ger_Autonomy3:0 "정부 중앙 집권화"
BAT_Ger_Autonomy3_desc:0 "The apparatus of the Ducal government is weak, rife with corruption and heavily decentralised, we must enact substantial governmental reforms before advancing forward, so that our country may prosper even without the help of the Kaiser."

BAT_Ger_Autonomy4:0 "사슬을 끊어라"
BAT_Ger_Autonomy4_desc:0 "The rift between Baltic Germans and the government of the Kaiserreich is growing deeper every day, and we can use this as an opportunity to finally increase our autonomy and maybe even finally obtain free elections for all."

BAT_Fed2:0 "발트 연방"
BAT_Fed2_desc:0 "Andrevs Niedra, a puppet head of government we placed to pacify the locals, has proposed a seemingly radical idea, reforming the Duchy into a democratic Baltic Federation, where not only Germans, but also the local Balts can have a say in how they are ruled. It seems like a good idea after all."

BAT_Fed3:0 "첫번째 총선"
BAT_Fed3_desc:0 "We have promised free elections as part of the future of our newly founded Federation, and it is high time for us to fulfil this promise. The Baltic peoples will now finally decide the fate of their country."

BAT_Fed5:0 "독립 투표"
BAT_Fed5_desc:0 "We had never truly planned to break our ties with Germany, but more and more people are demanding the Baltic Federation to become an independent state. We have found a compromise, an independence referendum. Of course, even with a majority in favour of independence, there's no telling whether the Kaiser will approve."

BAT_Education:0 "교육 개혁"
BAT_Education_desc:0 "The large Latvian and Estonian contingent in the Baltic Landtag is demanding a comprehensive education reform. Latvian and Estonian need to be accepted as secondary languages and the discrimination against the local Balts in schools must stop. This seems acceptable."

BAT_Press:0 "언론의 자유"
BAT_Press_desc:0 "Ever since the foundation of our nation, there have been severe limitations to the freedom of our press.

BAT_Lib1:0 "자유 공국"

BAT_Lib2:0 "공국의 선거"
BAT_Lib2_desc:0 "The liberals demand a free election to be held for the Landtag! It may seem like a radical proposal, but times are clearly changing. The near absolutism we used to live in may no longer endure as democracy once again shines on the horizon of Europe."

BAT_Lib3:0 "문화적 평등"
BAT_Lib3_desc:0 "Germans, Balts, Estonians and Russians, we are all the same. We must follow the principles of equality and extend the rights of cultural autonomy to all nations within the state. Even if the Baltic Germans are to remain dominant, of course."

BAT_Lib4:0 "경제 자유화"

BAT_ERP_Gov1:0 "정부의 개입"
BAT_ERP_Gov1_desc:0 "We cannot allow this stagnation to continue. The government should assume control of all the major facilities. It is a harsh policy that will surely stifle our private sector, but it will steer our economy out of trouble."

BAT_ERP_Gov2:0 "도로 건설"
BAT_ERP_Gov2_desc:0 "Many unemployed citizens are trying to find any kind of job. We can help them by sending them on construction works. They will build up our roads and we will pay them. This way we can kill two birds with one stone."

BAT_ERP_Gov3_desc:0 "To solve our economic problems, we need a stable society. Some benefits for the poorest in our Duchy should be established. Everybody deserves at least basic economic security, and this will help maintain order in our population."

BAT_Eco_Naval2_desc:0 "There are many countries around the Baltic sea. We desperately need new trade partners, and they can indeed be very good trade partners to us. We should we establish new trade routes in the Baltic sea."

BAT_Eco_Naval3:0 "해군 혁신"
BAT_Eco_Naval3_desc:0 "Our recent naval activity has shown that our navy should be reorganised. We can learn many new things from major countries and use this knowledge in our projects for both the merchant navy and our growing Baltic fleet."

BAT_ERP_FM1:0 "현지 기업에 의존"
BAT_ERP_FM1_desc:0 "We cannot allow this stagnation to continue. If we enact strong laissez-faire policies, it will open many opportunities for local businesses and the private sector. Our capitalists and the free market will save the economy."

BAT_Army_Start:0 "Baltic Army"
BAT_Army_Start_desc:0 "Officially, we do have an army. But it actually consists of nothing more than a bunch of young boys with rifles. Military doctrine is the first thing we need to modernise. Decades have passed since the end of the Weltkrieg and our current doctrine is now clearly outdated."

BAT_Army_Cons:0 "Conscription Question"
BAT_Army_Cons_desc:0 "Native Balts, the majority of our country's population, are not currently allowed to serve in the army. Should we finally lift some of these restrictions, or should we keep the army the sole affair of the Germans?"

BAT_Army_Inf1_desc:0 "Most of our troops use clearly obsolete equipment. The Weltkrieg is long over, we need to change our equipment so that our brave soldiers fight with the best money and technology has to offer. We are a militia no more!"

BAT_Army_Inf2:0 "Improve our Training System"
BAT_Army_Inf2_desc:0 "We should reorganise and modernise our training system. New drilling methods will shorten boot camp times and stronger emphasis on actual combat training will increase the combat readiness of our troops."

BAT_Army_Doc1:0 "War Games"
BAT_Army_Doc1_desc:0 "Our military staff still push for old tactics and doctrines. We desperately need to change their minds. If we start organising regular war games, we will slowly but surely force them to adapt to the realities of modern warfare."

BAT_Army_Doc2:0 "Modern Doctrine Effort"
BAT_Army_Doc2_desc:0 "Now our generals are prepared for the realities of today's warfare. But even better, they now seem to have finally adopted a more innovative and forward-thinking mindset. Let us warmly welcome any suggestions from them, to seek new tactics to implement."

BAT_Army_Mot:0 "Mobile Army"
BAT_Army_Mot_desc:0 "We can significantly improve the speed of our troops by simply adopting motorised vehicles as an integral part of our division design. These new troops will be attached to their trucks as cavalry were with their horses, now we just need to figure out the tactical and organisational details."

BAT_Army_Arm:0 "Armour Blueprints"
BAT_Army_Arm_desc:0 "It seems that tanks become more and more powerful and practical every day, not that the Weltkrieg had not already showcased their potential by shattering the tactics of trench warfare. Every modern army will come to rely on them, and so should we. We will build our own."

BAT_Army_Def1:0 "Modern Artillery"
BAT_Army_Def1_desc:0 "The artillery cannon will always be useful. But as any kind of equipment, we should seek to modernise it. New artillery will be even more powerful than we can yet imagine, with bigger calibers, bigger guns, and bigger payloads."

BAT_Army_Fort1:0 "Ostwall Fortifications"
BAT_Army_Fort1_desc:0 "The Ostwall is a concept for a line of fortifications along the Russian border. It will take a long time to complete but the results will be impressive, and its tactical advantages obvious."

BAT_Army_Fort2:0 "Improve Ostwall"
BAT_Army_Fort2_desc:0 "The construction of the Ostwall is now under way. Many workers and soldiers work on it every day. Sooner or later, the work will be complete, but we should be ready to invest additional effort to speed up the project should trouble arise."

BAT_Army_FortGer:0 "Forced Labour"
BAT_Army_FortGer_desc:0 "Our workers are simply too slow. Why are these bloody Balts resting while our German boys are ahead of their schedule? We must force them to work, so the Ostwall will be complete even faster than we have predicted."

BAT_Army_FortBal:0 "Invest in Construction Network"
BAT_Army_FortBal_desc:0 "Our workers are simply too slow. If we create even more job vacancies, the work might be done even faster than we have predicted. In all cases, we can only get the work done faster by investing into it selflessly."

BAT_Army_FortComplete:0 "New Ostwall Line"
BAT_Army_FortComplete_desc:0 "The new Ostwall Line is finally complete. Now, our borders are safe and strong. We do not need to fear the Russians anymore, let them come to us. See if they can even set a foot into Livland or Estland."

BAT_RUS_INT1:0 "Russification"
BAT_RUS_INT1_desc:0 "The vile Germans are no longer our masters. Russia has shown deep interest in the prosperity of our new state. We should strengthen our ties with them by promoting the Russian culture all across our lands."

BAT_RUS_INT2:0 "Baltic German Question"
BAT_RUS_INT2_desc:0 "Baltic Germans always were a minority in our states, propped up by aggressive Germanisation policies from Berlin. Now that the Kaiser's hold on our country has been shattered, what should we do with them?"

BAT_RUS_INT3:0 "Introduce Russian Language"
BAT_RUS_INT3_desc:0 "Our Russian masters have encouraged us to embrace the Russian language as our only official language. This will take time and cause some issues, as all our official texts are currently in German or Baltic languages, and a majority of our population is still German or Baltic."

BAT_RUS_INT4:0 "Begin Full Integration"
BAT_RUS_INT4_desc:0 "Russians gain more and more influence over us every day. It seems that soon we will be integrated into their empire. We should send a delegation to their government to negotiate terms and ensure our autonomy is respected, at least for now."

BAT_RUS_INT5:0 "End of Pribaltika"
BAT_RUS_INT5_desc:0 "We have been ruled by the Russians for a long time. The very existence of our Baltic country no longer makes any sense. We will send another delegation to Russia to push for the annexation of our country and join our Russian brothers!"

BAT_Army_Mil_Navy1:0 "Baltic Fleet"
BAT_Army_Mil_Navy1_desc:0 "Since Peter the Great, many naval battles have been fought in the Baltic Sea. We are proud of the prestige and legacy of our navy and we will focus on improving our ships even more."

BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_Old:0 "Naval Traditions"
BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_Old_desc:0 "The power of our navy lies in its traditions. Instead of investing endless funds into new hulls, we can always improve and refit our old ships. A battleship shall always be a battleship."

BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_New:0 "New Naval Technologies"
BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_New_desc:0 "Traditions are good, but we can't afford to forget about new technologies. Instead of praising the old ways, we should invest our funds into some brand new naval technologies like submarines."

BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_Doc:0 "Our Brave Officers"
BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_Doc_desc:0 "Our naval officers are some of the best officers of Europe. We should encourage them and create more favourable working conditions for them to encourage them to stay and improve our navy."

BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_Transport:0 "Elite Baltic Marines"
BAT_Army_Mil_Navy_Transport_desc:0 "With our long coastline, we will always be threatened by naval invasions. We should teach some of our troops to fight in such conditions and even perform autonomous naval landings."

BAT_Air1:0 "Expand Air Bases"
BAT_Air1_desc:0 "Aviation never was our forte, ever since the introduction of airplanes during the Weltkrieg we have been struggling to catch up. We should build some airfields now and start training for the future of warfare."

BAT_Air_CAS:0 "CAS Effort"
BAT_Air_CAS_desc:0 "A modern army needs support from vehicles not only on the ground, but also in the air. Certainly a concept that will be easy for our officers to understand."

BAT_Air_Fighter:0 "Fighter Effort"
BAT_Air_Fighter_desc:0 "We have not seen the last of the dogfights in the Weltkrieg. Keeping ahead in the development of fighter planes will give us an edge future air battles."

BAT_Air_Nav_Bomber:0 "Naval Bomber Effort"
BAT_Air_Nav_Bomber_desc:0 "Ships have proven exceptionally vulnerable to aircrafts. We should keep improving on their technology to ensure we stay ahead of any countermeasures and get the edge in large naval confrontations."

BAT_Air_Doc:0 "Air Innovations"
BAT_Air_Doc_desc:0 "Modern wars cannot be won without dominating the skies. We must do everything in our power to develop the air force until we are able to protect our skies as well as we protect our seas and lands!"

BAT_Air_End:0 "Baltic Aviation"
BAT_Air_End_desc:0 "Now, that is what we call aviation. Our recent efforts have shown very impressive results. Maybe we are not the kings of the sky, but our pilots can fight well enough to give any enemy plane a run for his money."

BAT_Education_Ger:0 "Education Reform"
BAT_Education_Ger_desc:0 "With more power to the Duke, the time has come for us to rethink our system of education. We have made some great strides in educating the younger masses, but our universities are already full. If we invest some money and open more universities, more people will get a higher education."

### Ideas ###

BAT_multi_ling:0 "정치 불안정"
BAT_multi_ling_desc:0 "Our country is an union of multiple cultures. The Native Balts, the Germanised Balts and the Russian minorities all vie for political influence, causing regular conflict and difficulty to set a common policy. This is only made much worse by the German dominance caused by the Kaiser's policies of Germanisation, crushing minority rights and forcing cultural conversion of the 'Native Balts'."

BAT_start_crisis:0 "징병 사태"
BAT_start_crisis_desc:0 "Only people of German descent or having sufficiently Germanised are allowed into the armed forces. Naturally, as the majority of the people in our country are Native Balts and resistance to Germanisation is still high, this poses massive conscription issues. However, due to significant unrest and the ever present risk of a revolt, this is currently seen as a necessary evil."

BAT_multi_ling_aut:0 "미약한 자치"
BAT_multi_ling_aut_desc:0 "Following some diplomatic manoeuvring, we have successfully put an end to the Kaiser's plans of Germanisation. Our country is still shattered, but our people are grateful that we saved our minorities from cultural indoctrination. These wounds will take time to heal, but at least they will be able to heal."

BAT_german_majority:0 "과반수 독일인"
BAT_german_majority_desc:0 "Following a recent push for Germanisation, we have finally achieved a significant milestone. The majority of our country is now considered German, and as such our position in the country as the majority culture is secure. This not only allows us to finally end the recent instability, but also to enforce the will of the German people on those Native and Russian rebels."

BAT_schools:0 "새로운 교육 시스템"
BAT_schools_desc:0 "Reforming our education system is easier said than done. But with some improvements made to our curriculum, we expect that our country's literacy will increase, and higher education will eventually become a reality to a larger part of our youth, with benefits all across our society."

BAT_factory:0 "경제 호황"
BAT_factory_desc:0 "The liberalisation of our economy has had the effect that we hoped, with construction and production once again roaring through our lands. This allows us to contract our newly-recovered economy to peform major infrastructure works, faster and cheaper."

BAT_militia:0 "발트 민병대"
BAT_militia_desc:0 "With the mighty German army promising to defend our country against aggression, the organisation of our country's military from its very inception has been relaxed, to say the least. We need to remedy to this, wherever we are to still benefit of Germany's protection, or especially if we are to lose it."

BAT_Black_Monday:0 "검은 월요일의 여파"
BAT_Black_Monday_desc:0 "As a country deeply within the Kaiserreich's sphere of influence, the impact of the Black Monday has been brutal to our economy. However, we cannot wait for Germany to fix her own economy, there is work to be done at home. The unrest cannot be ignored, and might be costly if left to boil."

BAT_gov_goods:0 "사회 투자"
BAT_gov_goods_desc:0 "Welfare is turning out to be one of the most important policies we have to help our people cope with this crisis. This also creates a situation where the poorest of our society can now prosper in our country, allowing us to slowly scale down the emergency programs."

BAT_heavy_industry:0 "발트 노동자들"
BAT_heavy_industry_desc:0 "With the effort of some of our people redirected to military factories, we have finally managed to improve our production of military hardware. This will create a skilled and dedicated military workforce on the long run. If some are to be believed, one that will come handy sooner than desired."

BAT_scientists:0 "새로운 과학자들"
BAT_scientists_desc:0 "Scientific discoveries don't just magically appear out of thin air. By investing heavily in scientific pursuits even in times of trouble, we encourage our scientists and research teams to give the best for our country, and merely give them the means to do so."

BAT_pol:0 "정치적 설립"
BAT_pol_desc:0 "There might be those who decry the new influence of some capitalists on our economy, but this direct connection of the political and economic worlds allow us to strengthen our decision-making and help influence our nation's economy, for the better."

BAT_drill:0 "현대 훈련 시스템"
BAT_drill_desc:0 "Training a soldier is more complex than teaching him how to shoot his rifle and throw his hand grenades. By perfecting our drill system, we make boot camp faster, more efficient at turning the average citizen into a competent soldier, and thus capable of more rapidly mobilising new divisions, even those of a new concept to us."

BAT_fort:0 "동부방벽 요새화 연결망"
BAT_fort_desc:0 "The Ostwall is more than a few isolated bunkers. A complex and carefully designed network of fortication works, integrating natural chokepoints and artificial constructions alike, it will prove a challenge to any invading forces. Likewise, it will also help us design future expansions, and even brand new fortification lines."

BAT_balts_rebellion:0 "발트인들의 반란"
BAT_balts_rebellion_desc:0 "우리의 식민화 정책으로 인해 발트 3국 거주민들이 들고 일어났습니다. 우리는 정치적 상황에 따라 독일의 도움없이 우리 스스로 해결할 수 있습니다 (독일을 전쟁에 부르지 않는 것이 좋습니다)."
