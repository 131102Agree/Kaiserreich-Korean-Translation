BRA_election_year_desc:0 "아마도 브라질 역사상 가장 폭력적이고 논쟁이 많은 선거를 준비하면서 긴장감이 고조되고 있습니다. 정치적 대화는 열띤 논쟁과 거의 동의어이며 이념적 극단주의의 분위기가 국가의 대중을 둘러싸고 나타나고 있습니다."
BRA_decentralization_desc:0 "브라질 연방 공화국은 자국의 자치권을 항상 소중히 여겨왔습니다. 각자가 자신의 대통령, 자신의 정당, 그리고 자신의 군대를 가지고 있으며, 국민들은 이러한 지역 권리를 위해 기꺼이 죽을 각오가 되어 있습니다. 그러나, 이것은 매우 약하고 이빨 빠진 중앙 정부로 귀결되는데, 이것은 필요할 때 결단력 있게 행동하게 할 수 없습니다."	
BRA_wake_of_civil_war_desc:0 "내전만큼 회복에 오래 걸리는 상처는 거의 없습니다. 미나스 제라이스의 군대가 상파울루에 침입한 후 정치적 과두 정부와 지역 정체성 사이의 긴장이 마침내 전쟁터로 쏟아져 나감에 따라, 전쟁은 수천 명의 사망자와 더 많은 고아와 노숙자를 남겼습니다. 중앙 정부가 하려고 하는 어떤 행동들은 현재 엄청난 불신으로 보여지고 있고, 리오와 상파울루 사이의 국경에 야기된 완전한 피해는 아직 완전히 복구되지 않았습니다."
BRA_fatherland_volunteers_desc:0 "위대한 역사에서 우리 군대의 유산을 기리는, 조국 자원병들은 공통된 브라질 사람들로부터 길러진 힘 그 이상이며, 이들은 국가를 위해 기꺼이 죽을 그들의 의지와 자유를 상징합니다."
BRA_forager_idea_desc:0 "브라질에 군대를 보급하는 물류 병참은, 우리 군인들의 자율성을 요구하기에, 우리 군대는 가능한 한 많은 자원을 쓸 수 있는 능력을 가져야 합니다."
BRA_planningspeed_desc:0 "우리의 장교들은 함께 작전을 계획할 수 있고, 어떤 경우에든 그 계획을 적용할 수 있습니다; 결론적으로, 전투 계획은 적과의 교전에서 뜻대로 되지는 않습니다."
BRA_we_werent_expecting_special_forces_desc:0 "브라질의 특수부대는 잘 훈련되었으며, 그들은 외국의 침략으로부터 나라를 지키기 위해 몇 년을 전쟁의 기술을 연마하는데 보냈습니다. 그들의 수와 지형에 대한 숙달은 확실히 침략자가 조사해야 될 요소일 것입니다."
BRA_state_armies_desc:0 "브라질의 군대는, 간단히 말해서, 리우데자네이루에서 소위 '연방군'으로 불리는 26개 주의 민병대로 이루어진 군집단이고, 브라질의 해군이 실제 연방 정부 산하의 군대의 거의 유일한 무기입니다. 이 거대하며 고풍스럽게 조직된 병력은 훈련과 장비 모두에서 질적으로 매우 다르며, 어떤 면에서도 현대 전투에는 적합하지 않습니다."
BRA_militiagungs_desc:0 "민병대들은 특별 국가 주방위군으로 적절히 통합되었고, 현대적인 방식으로 조직되고 장비를 갖추고 있으며 브라질을 위해 싸우고 죽을 준비가 되어 있습니다."
BRA_merchant_marine_desc:0 "브라질은 항상 국제 무역의 나라였습니다. 그 명성 자체가 브라질의 가장 강력한 수출품인 브라질우드에서 유래되었기 때문입니다. 상품을 수입할 수 있는 우리의 능력은 중요한 전략적 요소이며, 상선의 확장은 공식적으로 국가가 후원합니다."
BRA_patriotism_desc:0 "우리 국민들은 브라질이 하나의 통일국이라는 개념에 서서히 익숙해지고 있지만, 때가 되면, 통합된 정체성을 구축하려는 우리의 노력이 반드시 뿌리를 내릴 것입니다."
BRA_cangaco_is_over_desc:0 "주 사이의 강도율은 사상 최저이며, 시골과 도시 모두 범죄자들이 체포를 피하기 위해 주 경계를 넘나들 수 없기 때문에 훨씬 더 안전하다고 느낍니다."
BRA_higher_learing_desc:0 "대학 교육을 마친 우리나라의 인원을 늘리기 위해 많은 자금이 투입되고 있습니다. 우리는 한때 특권이었던 것을 모두가 접근할 수 있는 것으로 바꾸기를 바랍니다."
BRA_manter_isso_ai_viu_desc:0 "지지 편지에서 수상한 모임에 이르기까지 우리는 정치적, 경제적 안정을 보장하기 위한 조치를 전혀 취하지 않았습니다. 정치는 잔인하고 사악한 게임이지만, 패배의 결과는 혼란스러울 것입니다!"
BRA_cheap_cars_desc:0 "관대한 세금 감면 덕분에, 우리 자동차 산업은 엄청난 효율성과 심지어 더 큰 이익을 위해 일하고 있으며, 주 정부에 우리의 요구에 맞는 모든 종류의 차량을 공급할 수 있습니다."
BRA_black_monday_1_desc:0 "검은 월요일의 우리 경제에 대한 파괴는 엄청난 규모입니다. 우리는 폭풍을 이겨내고 빠르게 줄어드는 예산으로 먹고살려고 노력하는 것 외에는 거의 할 수 없습니다..."
BRA_black_monday_2_desc:0 "새 정부는 우리 경제의 위기를 다루기 위해 적절한 조치를 취해왔고 최악의 상황은 끝났습니다. 그러나, 피해는 여전히 계속되고 있고, 우리 시장에는 공개적인 상처가 있으며, 추가적인 조치가 취해져야 합니다."
BRA_bigger_salaries_desc:0 "대통령 선거 운동 기간 중 약속했던 대로 공무원의 임금 인상률이 공식적으로 증가했습니다. 자연스럽게, 이것은 비용이 들더라도 우리의 정치적 상황을 개선합니다."
BRA_it_prints_money_desc:0 "과도한 지출은 심각한 인플레이션 문제의 시작이 될 수 있는 결과를 낳았습니다. 우리는 이 문제를 즉시 처리해야만 합니다. 우리는 계속 치솟는 물가의 무게로 엄청나게 고통받을 수 있기 때문입니다."
BRA_freedom_of_press_desc:0 "모든 기자들이 모든 문제에 대해 보도할 권리는 자유의 근본적인 측면이며, 우리는 그것이 위험에 처하도록 결코 허용하지 않을 것입니다; 우리의 검열 금지 법안은 아마도 서반구에서 가장 강력할 것입니다."
BRA_freedoms_desc:0 "개인의 권리는 항상 국가의 필요보다 우선합니다: 정부의 최우선 과제는 시민들의 권리를 보호하는 것이어야지, 그것을 빠져나갈 세금 소득 비축금으로 취급해서는 안 됩니다!"
BRA_tax_breakings_desc:0 "검은 월요일 위기의 여파로 인한 긴급 복구 조치로 농가 소유주와 같은 몇몇 전략 부문에 상당한 세금 우대 조치가 내려졌습니다."
BRA_salarys_marlib_desc:0 "한 걸음 뒤로 물러나서 공공 임금을 다시 인상함으로써, 우리는 그들의 인상률을 훨씬 더 합리적인 비율로 정했고, 예산에 친환경적으로 필요한 숨 쉴 공간을 주었습니다."
BRA_marlib_loans_desc:0 "강도 높고 광범위한 재정 개혁은 연방정부와 주정부들의 예산 상황을 크게 개선했습니다."
BRA_am_i_being_detained_desc:0 "우리의 법은 항상 우리의 자유의 초석이 되어왔고, 이 어려운 시기에도 다르지 않습니다. 우리는 항상 다른 무엇보다도 국민의 자유를 존중해야 합니다."
BRA_good_natives_desc:0 "최초의 브라질 사람들은 가혹하지만 공정한 법 아래 보호받고 있으며, 만약 그들이 제국의 나머지에서 고립된 채 살고 싶다면 그렇게 하는 것은 그들의 권리 내에서 충분히 가능합니다. 그들의 고귀하고 순수한 생활방식을 더럽히는 사람은 누구입니까?"
BRA_advisory_parliament_desc:0 "의회는 이제 간단한 자문 역할을 하고 있으며, 군주의 말은 항상 의도했던 대로 최종적이고 절대적인 것입니다."
BRA_anmon_gang_desc:0 "소위 말하는 주정부의 권력은, 브라질을 해체하기 위한 공화당원들의 도구보다 더 적은 것들로 적절히 처리되었습니다. 브라질은 국민들을 위해 일하는 정부에 한 걸음 더 가까워졌습니다."
BRA_are_you_threatening_me_master_jedi_desc:0 "사람들의 의지를 적절하게 대표하는 진정한 유기적인 그리고 분권화된 국가는 현재 현실이 되었습니다. 각 도시마다 생디칼리스트 노예가 생각할 수 있는 것보다 더 많은 자유가 있기 때문입니다. 신은 진정 우리 제국을 축복했습니다."
BRA_blueguard_desc:0 "황실 청위대들은 지적이고 충성스럽습니다; 그들은 외국 스파이들과 생디칼리스트들의 거짓말에 대한 첫 번째 방어선입니다."
BRA_krush_desc:0 "우리는 군 기병대의 전통과 자금 지원을 모두 회복했고, 이제 이 제국의 강력한 방어자들은 그들이 항상 받을 만한 훈련과 장비를 가지고 있습니다."
BRA_stubborness_desc:0 "우리 제국은 아무리 비용이 많이 들더라도 결코 우리를 반대하는 어둠의 세력에게 굴복하지 않을 것입니다!"
BRA_the_romena_desc:0 "새로운 헌법은 브라질에서 시행되고 있으며, 새로운 국가의 법적 기반입니다. 철저하게 권위주의적인 성향으로 인해 반대파들에 의해 '루마니아인'이라고 불렸지만, 실제로 철위대가 내놓을 수 있는 것이 훨씬 급진적입니다, 그러나 비판가들을 '반역자'로 체포할 수 있을 정도로 새로운 헌법은 새로운 국가가 철저하게 통제권을 장악하기 위한 뻔뻔스러운 시도입니다."
BRA_voz_do_brasil_desc:0 "구아나바라 만에서의, 19시간"
BRA_estado_novo_youth_desc:0 "우리 새로운 국가의 젊은이들은 브라질의 번영을 방해하려고 끊임없이 노력하는 생디칼리스트와 다른 폭도들을 다룰 준비가 되어 있습니다."
BRA_populsit_education_desc:0 "브라질 사람들은 가장 어린 시절부터, 가난한 사람들의 아버지가 나라를 완전한 파멸에서 구해냈고 나라를 위대함으로 되돌려 보냈다는 것을 알게 될 것입니다."
BRA_CLT_Vargas_desc:0 "새로운 국가는 항상 노동자들의 이권을 마음에 두고 있었고, 노동자의 권리를 위한 새로운 헌장이 공정하지도 않고 시기적으로도 한참 늦은 것이라고 주장할 사람은 거의 없습니다."
BRA_unlimited_powa_desc:0 "새로운 국가는 남미의 역사상 그 어느 나라보다도 더 큰 중앙집권화를 달성했을 것입니다. 바르가스 개인의 지시도 이 새로운 시대에 법이 될 수 있습니다."
BRA_anarcho_hueism_desc:0 "브라질의 독특한 역사와 문화는 우리가 프랑스와 브리튼에 관련된 생각을 적용할 수 없다는 것을 의미하며, 사유 재산에 대한 엄격한 소유권 감시를 가져서는 안 된다는 것 의미합니다. 정통적인 이념은 브라질의 진보를 방해할 수 없습니다!"
BRA_shrukie_state_desc:0 "물론 어려운 과정이지만, 우리는 주의 기관이 사람들의 삶에 미치는 영향을 줄이는데 많은 노력을 기울이고 있습니다."
BRA_mst_desc:0 "농지는 주로 그 땅에서 일하는 사람들에 의해 소유되고 운영되는 지역 협동조합에 재분배되었습니다. 그러나 개인은 여전히 그들이 땅에 부가하는 가치를 소유할 수 있습니다."
BRA_women_homefront_desc:0 "우리는 전시의 경우, 전 브라질 사람들이 전쟁터 안팎에서 그 역할을 할 준비가 되어있다는 것을 확실히 해야 합니다."
BRA_radsoc_literay_desc:0 "모든 브라질 인이 어디에서 살든지 간에 읽고 쓰는 법을 알 수 있도록 하기 위한 노력의 일환으로 대대적인 파업이 일어나고 있습니다."
BRA_christian_socialism_desc:0 "너희는 그 사람을 미워하고, 다른 사람을 사랑하거나, 그 사람에게 헌신하고, 다른 사람을 경멸할 것이다. 신과 돈 모두를 섬길 수는 없다."
BRA_radsoc_literay2_desc:0 "모든 브라질 인이 어디에서 살든지 간에 읽고 쓰는 법을 알 수 있도록 하기 위한 노력의 일환으로 대대적인 파업이 일어나고 있습니다."
BRA_people_militias_desc:0 "민병대는 이전 공화국의 주 민병대의 자손이며 법 집행과 수비 활동을 모두 처리합니다."
BRA_guns_desc:0 "폭정에 대한 최선의 방어는 우리가 지금 하고 있는 것처럼 국민들이 스스로 무장할 수 있도록 하는 것입니다."
BRA_nomnom_desc:0 "우리가 몇 년 안에 달성할 수 있는 어떤 조치로도 굶주림을 없애지는 못할 것입니다. 하지만 우리는 그 목표를 향해 엄청난 발전을 하고 있고, 우리는 짧은 몇 십 년 안에 그가 어디에서 왔든 간에, 그의 일생 동안 단 한 명의 브라질 사람도 음식을 찾는 데 하루도 보내지 않도록 보장할 수 있습니다."
BRA_kids_learn_materialism_desc:0 "사람들을 적절하게 교육하는 것은 아마도 우리 국가, 특히 생디칼리즘의 가치를 태어나면서 배워야 하는 아이들에게 가장 중요한 일일 것입니다."
BRA_cs_union_desc:0 "노동조합의회는 브라질 연합의 새로운 입법 기관입니다. 이것은 전 세계가 노동자의 민주주의를 볼 수 있는 훌륭한 예입니다."
BRA_cs_main_legistaltive_desc:0 "노동조합의회는 브라질 연합의 새로운 입법 기관입니다. 이것은 전 세계가 노동자의 민주주의를 볼 수 있는 훌륭한 예입니다."
BRA_cs_local_aswell_desc:0 "노동조합의회는 브라질 연합의 새로운 입법 기관입니다. 이것은 전 세계가 노동자의 민주주의를 볼 수 있는 훌륭한 예입니다."
BRA_adults_learn_materialism_desc:0 "우리의 거대한 교육 개혁은 이제 모든 수준의 교육에 도달했고, 새로운 세대의 지식인들이 우리를 미래로 이끌기 위해 빠르게 일어섰습니다."
BRA_cs_powerful_desc:0 "노동조합의회는 브라질 연합의 새로운 입법 기관입니다. 이것은 전 세계가 노동자의 민주주의를 볼 수 있는 훌륭한 예입니다."
BRA_washy_washy_desc:0 "가난을 낭만적으로 묘사하고 극심하게 비위생적인 장소에서 사는 것은 혐오스러운 운명입니다. 개인의 개인 소원은 특히 공중 보건 문제에서 사회의 요구에 우선순위를 두고 있지 않습니다."
BRA_shining_syndies_desc:0 "브라질 연합은 생디칼리스트 국가가 되기를 열망하는 것의 예시입니다. 전 국민이 전례 없는 평화와 안정의 시대를 살고 있기 때문에, 사슬은 부서지고 책과 빵으로 대체되었습니다."
BRA_pray_or_gulash_desc:0 "우리의 성직자들은 우리의 새로운 정권을 전적으로 지지합니다. 왜냐하면 그들은 우리 정권의 대안이 사람들의 영혼을 위험에 빠뜨리는 것이라는 것을 알기 때문입니다."
BRA_helpful_spies_desc:0 "국가에서 어떠한 연합이나 유대관계도 없는 이 외국 스파이들은 차갑고 필요한 군사 정보 업무에 완벽합니다. 노동자의 연대는 여러 가지 형태가 있습니다..."
BRA_dops_desc:0 "정치 및 사회 질서부는 대학과 반혁명적 불안의 온상들을 돌며 항상 우리의 원대한 원칙을 옹호할 준비가 되어 있습니다."
BRA_pravda_desc:0 "지금 많은 국영 언론들은 선전이기 때문에 뉴스와 팸플릿에 대해 확신할 수 있는 사람은 거의 없습니다."
BRA_thats_racist_desc:0 "브라질은 현재 세계에서 가장 강력한 반인종차별 법안을 가지고 있으며, 동료 시민들에게 비방하는 것은 용납할 수 없는 일입니다. 우리는 모두 하나님과 황제 밑에서 평등하고, 그렇지 않다고 생각하는 것은 반역입니다!"
BRA_the_red_army_desc:0 "브라질 연합군은 더 나은 미래를 위해 노동자들의 의지의 정점으로 개편되고 재편되었습니다: 붉은 군대."
BRA_industrialist_soft_approach_desc:0 "우리는 이 나라의 강력한 산업 부호들을 부드럽게 다루고 있습니다."

BRA_afro_religions:0 "Safeguard African Culture"
BRA_afro_religions_desc:0 "The African people of Brazil have long been ignored by the republic; an unsurprising fact, considering how it was founded and maintained by former slave owners, who resented the monarchy for ending the cruel practice.

BRA_criminalize_racism:0 "Criminalize Racist Offenses"

BRA_aid_africa:0 "The Burden We Bear"
BRA_aid_africa_desc:0 "It's not a light burden, that to take up the mission to civilize.

He announced his intentions to run for president officially earlier today in Porto Alegre, to a roaring crowd of citizens who wish for the republic to finally achieve stability, and are tired of opportunists attempting to decieve them. Among his promised goals is a planned industralization program, better salaries for workers and bringing Brazil 'to the modern age'."

While their meeting was publically regarding donations to poor neighbourhoods in cities near Rio, the fact is that they are likely maling plans for an eventual Integralist electoral victory. Integralism in Brazil is highly influenced by Portugal, even if being an openly monarchist party is technically illegal, and thus the meeting stirred up much controversy, for it is proof for many of the AIB's true alliegance.

Said participation and commitment to racial equality is represented by their former candidate to the presidency, and current VP nominee Arlindo Veiga dos Santos, a deeply monarchist intellectual who denounces the leaders of the republic as former slave lords, who just mask themselves under new guises. However, the presidency candidate, Gustavo Dodt Barroso, is far more hostile and has not been shy in demostrating his anti-semitism, claming the capitalist classes of Brazil are puppets of the Elders of Zion.

This big tent organization of the party made choosing a presidential candidate difficult, even if it wasn't a particularly contentious process. João Mangabeira is probably more well known for being the left wing brother of president Mangabeira than his own career, but this recognition may very well be his greatest asset in what is probably going to be a complicated electoral process.

However, in Rio and many other places, the common people are in favour of a more modern government, for the people and by the people, not shackled by oligarchies.

Certain elements of the military attempted to apprehend the president, and they were quickly repelled and order was restored in the capital. While some opponents also claim this coup attempt was fabricated, it remains no doubt that Vargas is the most powerful man in Brazil since the days of the Empire, and that his vision for Brazil has been influenced by many foreign thinkers; some of his new proposals for the constitution have been derogatorily called 'Romanian', as a reference to the notoriously authoritarian Eastern European regime.

The idea of a known syndicalist radical meeting with the president is seen as both absurd and borderline treason, and many military offiers, and the press, issued statements that more read like ultimatums to our government than anything. If we fold to their demands, we will be arresting an innocent man and falling out of favour with any leftists in our nation and abroad; the opposite is true if we do not, but the danger of civil war looms on the horizon.

Three main ideological factions arose in the small time we had to ponder and debate. The Orthodx Syndicalists are, as the name suggest, the ones that are attuned to foreign intellectuals and European syndicalism, while the Autonomists see the European governments as exessively large and centralized, and claim that Brazil is simply too large and varied to be administrated in such a way. The third faction, the Maximalists, are a minority by a large margin, but their loud cries for action and strong leadership resonate with some leaders. No matter who walks off this first congress in power, this choice is an irreversible one for the path that our nation must take in following decades, and thus many debates are being held, even as forces outside the state seek to push for counterrevolution."

In a campaign that was in many ways impressive, Argentina managed to finally get their revenge for the final in 1930, and defeated Uruguay. However, the hardest game was the semi final against Brazil, an incredibly tense 1-0. History was made and now two nations can claim the title of world champion!"
bra.712.a:0 "Hurrah! We are victorious!"
bra.712.b:0 "We congratulate the winners"
bra.713.t:0 "Tenentist Uprising Quashed"
bra.713.d:0 "After several days of discontent, the barracks in Porto Alegre have risen in revolt, and were severly punished for their treason. A regrettable symptom of the trying times we live in."
bra.713.a:0 "A minor inconvenience"
bra.714.t:0 "Tenentist Uprisings Quashed"
bra.714.d:0 "More barracks have risen up in revolt, this time in Salvador. The local garrison claimed for fairer prices and a better democracy, but said vague demands were silenced by loyalists who stormed their barricaded living quarters"
bra.715.t:0 "Major Tenentist Uprising Quashed"
bra.715.d:0 "In Rio, São Paulo and several other cities, what seems to have been a coordinated revolt happened. However, the truth is different, and almost every mutineer had a different vision for Brazil and its future; even if most leaned slightly left in Rio itself, shaping public opinion on the uprising to be Syndicalist in nature. Regardless of their motives, the revolt quickly collapsed upon itself at the lightest of resistence from loyalists, but its impact shows immense fragility in our government both at home and abroad"
bra.715.a:0 "Regrettable"
bra.716.t:0 "Another Tenentist Uprising Quashed"
bra.716.d:0 "Yet another uprising in the barracks! While their demands were similar in nature to the previous ones, this time we managed to destroy the revolt in a relatively swift and decisive fashion"
bra.716.a:0 "Alright, that's enough now"

bra.719.d:0 "Inexplicably, the [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our petition, apparently deciding that [Root.GetNameDef] in their alliance is more trouble than it's worth."

bra.753.t:0 "Mission from [BRA.GetNameDef]"
bra.753.d:0 "[BRA.GetNameDef] has sent several ambassadors to us, requesting much closer ties with that nation. While the aid would most certainly be welcome, their second intentions of simply gaining influence and power in Africa are quite clear. Should we accept? "

bra.756.t:0 "The Brazilian Demands"
bra.756.d:0 "Brazil has sent what can pretty much be interpreted as a thinly veiled ultimatum to surrender diplomatic independence from them. While it's far from being a sensible request, Brazil's Emperor is almost certain to not take a refusal lightly... Our forces stand ready to defend us, but the choice ultimately falls to the president. What should we do?"
bra.756.a:0 "It seems we have no choice but to agree"

bra.758.d:0 "Paraguay's deluded leadeship has declared war! Lusting to conquer Brazil in the name of their insane ambitions of grandioise conquest, Paraguay has formally declared war on us, justifying said declaration on a fake ultimatum! The demands are cartoonilishly brazen, and were quickly debunked by the press. Now the Empire has a awoken, and we teach them a lesson that they won't forget!"

bra.760.t:0 "The Brazilian Demands"
bra.760.d:0 "Ever since the Empire of Brazil was proclaimed, few doubted they would try again to seek supremacy in the continent. Now, after months of tense diplomacy, Brazil used a few criminals crossing the border as an excuse for an ultimatum: Uruguay is to surrender its diplomatic independence and allow use of all its ports and roads to the Empire of Brazil. The intent is obviously to turn our nation into a puppet state, and to start to exert control over the River Plate; not to mention the agressive and coercive tone in the ultimatum. However, the Empire's power far dwarfs ours, or that of our possible allies in an eventual war; some say that accepting is the only way of saving Uruguay from a lost war and annexation"
bra.761.t:0 "[URG.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed"
bra.761.d:0 "Uruguay, realizing that the alternative was to become an Imperial province, has surrended use of all its ports and roads to the Brazilian Army, and recognized our protection on all diplomatic matters; they are safely under our wing and the River Plate is secured."
