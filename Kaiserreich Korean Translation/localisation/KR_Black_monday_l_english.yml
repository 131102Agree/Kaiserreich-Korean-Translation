black.1.a:0 "진지하게 부탁하는 거야!"
black.2.t:0 "검은 월요일"
black.2.d:0 "1936년 2월의 셋째 주가 시작되던 날, 베를린 증권 거래소의 시세 하강곡선은 멈추었다. 붕괴. 시장에 가해진 충격으로 촉발된 불안정성을 먹이삼아, 월요일 아침 증시가 열리자마자 분출적인 매각이 시작됐다. \n\nIt took well into the night for the teleprinters to stop sputtering out the results of what became known as Black Monday. When the results had been analysed, it was clear that the situation had only got worse.\n\nThe shock of this unprecedented economic catastrophe will, no doubt, be felt over the entire world. The German golden age has ended - for now, at least..."

black.3.t:0 "검은 월요일"
black.3.d:0 "On the third of February 1936, the Berlin Stock Exchange stopped sinking - it plunged. Fuelled by the instability of the market panic, selling erupted as soon as the stock market opened on Monday morning. \n\nIt took well into the night for the teleprinters to stop sputtering out the results of what became known as Black Monday. When the results had been analysed, it was clear that the situation had only got worse.\n\nThe shock of this unprecedented economic catastrophe will, no doubt, be felt over the entire world. The German golden age has ended - for now, at least..."

black.4.a:0 "임시적으로 은행의 문을 닫자."
black.4.b:0 "사유재산의 보호는 보장되어야지."

black.5.t:0 "암울한 한 주가 지나갔다"
black.5.d:0 "The situation hardly improved in the days following Black Monday, which was the start of what became known as Black Week. Panic-selling of stocks reached an all-time high as people tried to dump their stocks before they became worthless. When the Berlin Stock Market closed at the end of the week, the market was as dead as the 11 major economic experts and top executives in Germany had committed suicide. The German government had to act."
black.5.a:0 "경제 개혁을 해야만 한다."
black.6.t:0 "검은 월요일 이후 6개월"
black.6.d:0 "Six months have passed since Black Monday and the subsequent Black Week. One of the worst problems Germany had to face since then was a rising unemployment rate."

black.7.d:0 "Six months have passed since Black Monday and the subsequent Black Week. One of the worst problems Germany had to face since then was a rising unemployment rate."

black.8.t:0 "검은 월요일 이후 6개월"
black.8.d:0 "Six months have passed since Black Monday and the subsequent Black Week. One of the worst problems Germany had to face since then was a rising unemployment rate."

black.9.t:0 "검은 월요일 이후 1년"

black.11.t:0 "검은 월요일 이후 1년"
black.11.d:0 "One year has passed since Black Monday and the subsequent Black Week. The state of our industry is still recovering from the blow."

black.20.t:0 "전쟁 특수"
black.20.d:0 "Due to the war, industrial production across several sectors has skyrocketed and the workforce has endeavoured to fulfil their patriotic duty. This has had a net positive effect on the economy by reducing the aftermath of the Black Monday crash. It seems the economy is finally showing signs of life!"
black.20.a:0 "훌륭해."
black.21.t:0 "식민지의 경제난"
black.21.d:0 "Rising inflation and a consequently debased Reichsmark means that state expenses on German colonies had become too great to maintain pre-Black Monday tax codes. Some maverick politicians propose raising taxes, but raising taxes – on German nationals just to aid German colonials – would obviously not be popular, especially not under the present economic situation. Most of the Reichstag merely proposes limited financial support for our colonial possessions. What shall we do?"
black.21.a:0 "필요에 따라 식민지의 세금을 올리도록."
black.21.b:0 "Spare expenses only for the colonies under our direct control."

black.22.b:0 "우리 시민들을 도와라!"
black.23.t:0 "공업계 대기업의 파산 선언"
black.23.d:0 "Today, because of the state of our economy a major industrial corporation has unfortunately declared bankruptcy today. Several factories are going to close all over the country."

black.50.t:0 "제국 경제 정책"
black.50.d:0 "Finally, three years after Black Monday, our economy is slowly recovering! This can be the time to invest more to further secure our national interests!"
black.50.a:0 "본국에 투자하라!"
black.50.b:0 "식민지에 투자하라!"
black.50.c:0 "영향권 내 국가들에 투자하라!"
black.50.e:0 "이웃나라들에게 새 경제 협력 정책을 알려라!"

### Austria and Black Monday ###
black.200.t:0 "오스트리아를 강타한 검은 월요일"
black.200.d:0 "Black Monday has hit Germany and it would not be long before its shock-wave rippled across Europe. Given it's close proximity, Austria was among the first to affected. The economy is struggling and troubling times lie ahead."
black.200.a:0 "아, 맙소사!"
