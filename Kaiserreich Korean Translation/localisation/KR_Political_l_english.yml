kr.political.27.d:0 "호이4 카이저라이히에 새롭게 선보이는 안정도 시스템을 소개합니다. 안정도는 정치 화면에서 무역법 옆에 법률 형태로 되어있습니다. 당신의 정치력 점수가 안정도에 영향을 미칩니다. -50점 밑으로 내려가면 낮은 안정도로 떨어지고, -250 밑으로 떨어지면 매우 낮은 안정도로 떨어집니다, 그리고 -500 밑으로 가면 재앙이 될겁니다; 피하고 싶다면, 저를 믿으세요. 반대로 -500 이상이 되면 낮은 안정도로 올라가고, -250 이상이 되면 평균 안정도로 올라갑니다. \n\n좋은 안정도와 매우 좋은 안정도는 조금 다른데, 150 정치력점수를 얻은 다음에 법률을 선택하시면 됩니다. 이게 가능해질 때 알림을 받게 될겁니다. 한번이라도 정치력점수가 0 밑으로 갔다면, 긍정적인 안정도 단계를 잃을 겁니다. \n\n이벤트가 안정도를 올리거나 낮추는 부분은 바로 발동되지 않고, 발동되기 까지는 몇 달정도 걸린다는걸 명심하세요. 마지막으로, 여기 적힌 안정도를 변경하는 요구조건에 대해 잊어버리는 일이 생긴다면, 법률 화면에 있는 안정도 부분에 툴팁으로 볼 수 있습니다. 하지만 이걸 잊어버리는 일이 생기지는 않겠죠?"

kr.political.34.d:0 "왜 괴뢰국을 만들 수 없나요?\n이제 괴뢰화는 평화회담이 아닌, 이벤트나 국가중점을 통해서만 가능합니다.\n\nWhen will the next patch come out?\nWe aim for one big release every two months, and of course hot-fixes wherever needed.\n\nWhy are some of the models black?\nWe use some DLC assets in our mod, so if you don't have that DLC, you will get blank textures, don't worry though, they are just cosmetic errors. We are working on setting up backup textures to avoid this, so keep an eye out for updates.\n\nI want to do bug testing/art/music/coding for KR, where can I sign up?\nWonderful! Head to our discord, link on the forums, and message either ~mw~, Nijato or Zankoas.\n\nUpdate X broke my saves!\nThat isn't a question, but if you are having issues, try loading the save, saving again straight away without unpausing, then reloading using that new save. Not using ironman can also sometimes also help. If all else fails, remember past version are available for download on the KR4 forums.\n\nAre there any other parts to KR4?\nThe only other part is the music mod, which can be found in the steam workshop description or on the forums. You should definitely go get it."

Very rarely, slight changes to mod files can cause all events to refire when loading a save. Making a new save or reverting back to the old version avoids this issue.\n\nI found a bug, how can I make by bug report as helpful as possible?\nReport it only once per patch, we are busy people so don't worry if it takes us a few days to answer. The paradox forums bug report thread, or the steam workshop bug report thread are the best places to report, but please only report it on one of them. Try and check the last few pages to see if someone else has reported it. The more detail the better; screen shots and saves are much appreciated. Also try and check back a few days after reporting, we might have asked a question about your bug or just want to thank you. And as always, we really appreciate you taking the time to make KR4 the best it can be!"

kr.political.28.t:0 "뉴스 이벤트"
kr.political.28.d:0 "This is the president of the International News Tribune speaking. Kaiserreich is a mod deeply entrenched in lore and storytelling, conveyed through events, national focuses and other means. However, as the player, you might not even realise this, because most of the happenings in foreign countries are unknown to your eyes. Therefore we have created a system of news events that tell you about the major events that happened recently in other countries. They contain titbits of lore to help you understand the meaning and reasons for the events of the world, and they are also pretty and stuff. \n\nHowever, you may be a game tester or have a serious addiction with this being your 1000th game this week, or just a player who doesn't want popups in your face all the time, so you also have the option to turn this feature off entirely or allow only the important news events to fire.
