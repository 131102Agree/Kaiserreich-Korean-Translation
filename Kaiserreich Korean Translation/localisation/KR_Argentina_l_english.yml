ARG_Consolidate_Buenos_Aires_Capital_Region:0 "GBA 수도권 지역 통합"
ARG_Consolidate_Buenos_Aires_Capital_Region_desc:0 "비록 수도가 애국당과 ARA의 발 아래로 떨어지는 첫 번째 도시였지만, 부에노스 아이레스는 티그레 강에서 베라사테기의 오래된 도시에 이르기까지 거대한 문제입니다. 오래된 정부에 대한 충성스러운 여러 조직이 아직도 우리 지역에서 뿌리째 흩어져있어 그들을 근절하려는 우리의 모든 시도를 방해하고 있습니다."
ARG_Expand_the_Gendarmeria:0 "헌병대 설립"
ARG_Expand_the_Gendarmeria_desc:0 "불만 지역을 더 잘 통제하고 사태가 악화될 경우 신속한 대응력을 확보하기 위해서는 국방부 장관의 명령에 따라 반역하는 지방을 단속하기 위한 '아르헨티나 국가 헌병대'의 창설을 고려해야 합니다."
ARG_Control_the_Judiciaries:0 "사법부 통제"
ARG_Control_the_Judiciaries_desc:0 "우리나라에서 '반군'과 '생디칼리스트 동조자'의 수가 많기 때문에 사법 제도에 대한 완전한 통제력은 판사들이 범죄자들을 더 빨리 단속하도록 할 수 있습니다."
ARG_Secure_the_Military_Apparatus:0 "군사 조직 확보"
ARG_Secure_the_Military_Apparatus_desc:0 "우리는 ARA와 애국당 민병대에 대한 충성심 만 갖고 있기 때문에, 우리는 주둔군과 민병대 전초 기지가 우리 편이 되어 민주주의 세력을 제쳐두고 아르헨티나 군대가 우리를 위해 충분한 영향력을 행사할 수 있을 때까지 설득해야 합니다."
ARG_Control_the_Railroads:0 "철도 통제"
ARG_Control_the_Railroads_desc:0 "아르헨티나의 모든 철도는 부에노스 아이레스로 연결되어 있어 우리가 신속하게 시위를 진압하고 군대를 집결시킬 수 있는 독특한 위치에 있습니다. 하지만 사보타주와 반군은 이 선로를 크게 파손시켰고, 페르가미노, 바이아블랑카, 로사리오의 주요 철도 중심지를 우리가 전진하기 전에 확보해야 합니다."
ARG_Temporarily_Restrict_Civil_Rights:0 "일시적인 시민권 제한"
ARG_Temporarily_Restrict_Civil_Rights_desc:0 "헌법은 우리의 여러 정책들과 충돌하고 있으며 이번 위기가 끝날 때까지 일시적으로 중단되어야 합니다. 우리는 그 결정에 대한 강한 저항을 예상하지만, 그것은 우리의 위대한 국가를 위한 것이 될 것입니다!"
ARG_Seize_Disloyal_Garissons:0 "불충한 주둔군 장악"
ARG_Seize_Disloyal_Garissons_desc:0 "로사리오에서의 그들의 동맹들의 패배와 뒤이은 아군의 실패를 보면서, 과거의 불충한 많은 조직들이 편을 바꾸어 우리와 합류하고 있습니다."

ARG_Formation_of_the_Carles_Cabinet_desc:0 "아르헨티나에 대한 우리의 영향력은 거의 확보되었기 때문에, 우리는 마침내 카를레스의 개혁을 돕기 위해 충실하고 효율적인 내각을 세우는데 헌신할 수 있습니다."
ARG_Secure_Pampeana:0 "'라 팜파' 확보"
ARG_Secure_Pampeana_desc:0 "로사리오의 패배 이후, 우리는 팜파스 평원을 확보하고 남아 있는 모든 반대 세력을 뿌리 뽑기 위해 군대를 보내야 합니다. 하지만, 팜파스 평원은 세계에서 가장 큰 농경지 중 하나여서, 쉽지 않은 싸움이 될 것입니다."
ARG_March_on_Cordoba:0 "코르도바로의 행진"
ARG_March_on_Cordoba_desc:0 "코르도바 지방은 수도 부에노스 아이레스의 전망과 항상 조화를 이루지 못했습니다. 카를레스에 대항하는 연합의 지도자들과 수도와의 거리 때문에 코르도바 국민은 다루기 어렵다는 것이 증명되었고, 그들을 견제하기 위한 특수부대가 필요로 할 것입니다."
ARG_Consolidate_Mendoza:0 "멘도사 통합"
ARG_Consolidate_Mendoza_desc:0 "와인 생산으로 유명한 멘도사 지역은 칠레에 대한 가장 크고 안전한 산악 지대가 있음을 고려할 때, 우리나라의 핵심 경제 및 전략 지역이며, 따라서 모든 면에서 우리의 통제하에 되돌려 보내야 합니다."
ARG_Purge_Socialist_Remnants:0 "붉은 공포"
ARG_Purge_Socialist_Remnants_desc:0 "FOP가 독립을 선언한 후 거의 모든 사회주의 체제 지지자들이 남쪽으로 도망쳤음에도 불구하고, 몇몇은 여전히 FOP가 시작한 것을 끝낼 때까지 우리들 사이에 남아 있습니다, 이것은 우리에게 국가 안보를 염두에 두고 야당들 사이에서 반체제 인사들을 뿌리뽑을 완벽한 구실을 주고 있습니다."
ARG_Eradicate_Loyalist_Resistance:0 "보수적인 저항 근절"
ARG_Eradicate_Loyalist_Resistance_desc:0 "나라에 대한 우리의 통제가 날로 강해지면서 우리 정권을 아르헨티나 민주주의와 아르헨티나의 가치를 침해하는 것으로 보는 사람들도 여전히 있고, 그림자 속에서 우리들을 전복하려는 음모를 꾸미는 사람들도 있습니다. 이들 반역자들에 대한 징벌적인 행동과 선전은 국민들을 다시 정렬시키고 가능한 모든 저항을 진압해야 합니다."
ARG_Fall_of_Tucuman:0 "쿠만이 떨어지다"
ARG_Fall_of_Tucuman_desc:0 "쿠만은 우리나라의 중요한 산업 중심지는 아니지만 아르헨티나 애국자들이 아끼는 도시입니다. 그곳은 스페인으로부터 우리의 독립 선언이 마침내 서명되고 우리의 나라가 탄생한 도시입니다. 이제, 우리가 마침내 그 도시를 장악하게 되면 바로 그 도시가 민족적으로 재탄생하는 것을 목격하게 될 것입니다."
ARG_Corrientes_Campaign:0 "코리엔테스 캠페인 시작" 
ARG_Corrientes_Campaign_desc:0 "파라과이 사람들과의 긴장 관계는 우리가 이 지방을 다루는 데 특별히 조심해야 하고 그렇게 하지 않으면 파라과이의 침략을 유발할 수 있습니다. 특히 약한 시기에 그렇습니다. 그러나, 코리엔테스는 미시오네스로 가는 관문이며, 우리는 이 지방들을 어떤 외국의 적에게도 내주는 것을 거절합니다!"
ARG_Retake_Santiago_and_Salta:0 "산티아고와 살타 탈환"
ARG_Retake_Santiago_and_Salta_desc:0 "중요한 광산 지역과 귀중한 사탕수수의 생산 중심지인 이 지방들은 우리 경제에 중요한 그릇이고 그것을 반군의 손에서 되찾는 것이 우리의 의무입니다. 지금으로서는 상당히 덜 개발되었지만, 우리는 이 지방을 위한 계획을 가지고 있고 시간으로 이를 바꿀 수도 있습니다."
ARG_Political_Dominance:0 "완전한 정치적 지배"
ARG_Political_Dominance_desc:0 "야당은 공화국의 반역이며 이런 힘든 시기에 우리의 속도를 늦출 뿐입니다. 국가를 통치하려는 그들의 한심한 시도가 FOP 반란의 생존을 이끌어 낸 것이 아니었습니까? 우리는 카를레스가 '문명을 구하기 위해 야만에 맞서 희생할 수 있는 애국자 기사들도 있다'라고 말했듯이, 우리는 그들의 과거의 실수를 되풀이하지 않을 것입니다."

ARG_Countercoup:0 "성공적인 반쿠데타"
ARG_Countercoup_desc:0 "카를레스와 그의 광신자들은 물러났고 사람들은 다시 한번 자신들의 운명을 자유롭게 선택할 수 있게 되었습니다! 우리 모두 공화국의 위대함에 대해 자부심을 가집시다!" 
ARG_Safeguard_Democracy:0 "민주주의 수호"
ARG_Safeguard_Democracy_desc:0 "애국당과 같은 민족대중주의 정당들의 군사 쿠데타와 억압적인 정책들은 우리에게 피를 흘리게 했고 민주주의로부터 멀어졌습니다. 우리의 권리가 극단 주의자들에 의해 침해당하지 않도록 법적 보호 장치를 설치해야 합니다. 헌법 최고 우위의 원칙에 대해서는 더 이상 이의를 제기할 수 없습니다!"
ARG_Stability_on_the_streets:0 "거리의 안정"
ARG_Stability_on_the_streets_desc:0 "애국당의 주력 세력이 무너졌음에도 불구하고, 이 조직의 지지자들은 그렇게 쉽게 포기하려 하지 않고 부에노스 아이레스 거리에서 경쟁자들에게 공개적으로 도전장을 내밀었습니다. 폭동, 싸움, 총격전, 암살이 흔한 장소가 되었고 이제는 법과 질서를 회복하는 것이 우리의 의무입니다!"
ARG_Crack_down_on_Liga_Patriotica:0 "애국당 단속"
ARG_Crack_down_on_Liga_Patriotica_desc:0 "그들은 아르헨티나에 대한 야심 찬 목표를 달성하지 못하고 실패하였고, 우리는 우리 자신들의 한심한 잔재를 제거하고 이전보다 더 강하게 폐허에서 다시 태어나 일어서야 할 때입니다."
ARG_Free_Elections_of_the_Republic:0 "공화국의 자유 선거"
ARG_Free_Elections_of_the_Republic_desc:0 "국민들이 말하고 그들이 원하는 것은 완전한 민주주의입니다! 모든 사람이 결과에 만족하는 것은 아니지만, 모두 민주주의가 앞으로 나아가는 길이며 정부가 국민의 뜻을 존중해야 한다는 데 동의합니다."
ARG_Social_Reforms:0 "사회 개혁 시작"
ARG_Social_Reforms_desc:0 "정부와 노동계급 간의 노동 분쟁은 우리의 전임자들의 통치 기간 전반에 걸쳐 내내 레드 라인이었습니다. 진보적인 유럽 국가들의 예를 바탕으로 아르헨티나의 독특한 성격과 결합하여, 우리는 국가를 좀먹고 과거의 실수로부터 교훈을 얻은 문제들에 대해 강력한 사회적 해결책을 제공하기를 바랍니다."
ARG_Social_Reforms2:0 "사회 개혁 지속"
ARG_Social_Reforms2_desc:0 "정부와 노동계급 간의 노동 분쟁은 우리의 전임자들의 통치 기간 전반에 걸쳐 내내 레드 라인이었습니다. 진보적인 유럽 국가들의 예를 바탕으로 아르헨티나의 독특한 성격과 결합하여, 우리는 국가를 좀먹고 과거의 실수로부터 교훈을 얻은 문제들에 대해 강력한 사회적 해결책을 제공하기를 바랍니다."
ARG_Stepping_Stone_Towards_the_Welfare_State:0 "복지 국가를 향한 디딤돌"
ARG_Stepping_Stone_Towards_the_Welfare_State_desc:0 "국가는 익명의 자본가 조직을 기쁘게 하기 위해서가 아니라 국민들을 위해서 여기에 있습니다. 지속적인 사회 프로그램을 통해, 우리는 정부가 이 혹독한 세상에서 그들이 살아갈 수 있도록 시민들이 안심할 수 있는 복지 국가를 만들기 위해 노력할 것입니다."
ARG_Power_of_Capital:0 "자본의 힘"
ARG_Power_of_Capital_desc:0 "아르헨티나는, 우리 나라가 태어난 이래로, 세계에서 가장 부유한 국가들 중의 하나로 급부상했습니다. 영국인들이 파산한 후에 남긴 미납 부채와 FOP의 잇따른 반란은 우리를 지연시켰을 수도 있지만, 그렇다고 해서 번영을 향한 우리의 길을 막지는 못할 것입니다. 결국에는, 돈은 세상을 돌아가게 하고 아르헨티나는 이 세계의 일부입니다."
ARG_Attract_Foreign_Investement:0 "해외 투자 유치"
ARG_Attract_Foreign_Investement_desc:0 "우리는 우리의 산업 역량을 완전히 발전시킬 자본과 기술적 노하우가 부족하고 따라서 우리는 외국의 지원을 모색하고 산업 법의 일부를 완화함으로써 사업을 유치해야 합니다."
ARG_Uphold_Civil_Liberties:0 "시민의 자유를 인정하다"
ARG_Uphold_Civil_Liberties_desc:0 "개인의 자유는 우리의 헌법에 의해 보장되며 항상 우리의 최우선 과제가 되어야 합니다. 다시는 애국당과 같은 조직이 이러한 권리를 침해하는 것을 허락하지 않을 것입니다!"
ARG_Encourage_Free_Thought:0 "자유사상을 장려하다"
ARG_Encourage_Free_Thought_desc:0 "우리의 청년들은 아르헨티나의 미래이고 우리는 미래에 대한 두려움 때문에 정부의 제한으로 그들의 지성과 창의력을 방해해서는 안 됩니다."
ARG_Uphold_the_Status_Quo:0 "현재 상황을 유지하다"
ARG_Uphold_the_Status_Quo_desc:0 "최근 우리 나라의 발전은 우리 국민들이 급진적인 정치인들을 정말 불신하게 만들었습니다. 우리 국민들은 확고한 근거를 필요로 하고 다른 정당들이 권장하는 급진적인 생각들은 우리의 인기를 확보할 기회가 될 수도 있습니다. 보너스로, 군대에 있는 많은 장교들이 우리를 지지하고 있는데, 이것은 우리가 위험한 쿠데타에 대한 두려움 없이 좀 더 자유롭게 움직일 수 있게 해 줍니다."
ARG_Church_Ties:0 "교회와의 관계"
ARG_Church_Ties_desc:0 "믿음은 아르헨티나 사회의 핵심적인 기둥이고 교회와의 유대는 권력을 유지하기 위해 필수적입니다. 그들의 개발 사업을 장려하고 그것들을 무제한적인 자유로 허용하는 것은 현명한 결정임이 분명합니다."
ARG_Long_Live_the_Republic:0 "공화국 만세!"
ARG_Long_Live_the_Republic_desc:0 "우리는 우리 뒤에서 몇 년간 힘든 세월을 보냈지만 공화국의 정신은 살아남았고 우리는 그 어느 때보다 더 강하게 서 있습니다! 우리는 우리의 조상들이 싸웠던 체제를 유지할 것입니다! ¡아르헨티나 만세(Viva Argentina)!"
ARG_Rigged_Elections:0 "조작된 선거"
ARG_Rigged_Elections_desc:0 "우리의 사람들은 그들에게 이로운 점이 무엇인지 모르고, 그들은 허락된다면 심지어 FOP나 애국당 급진 주의자들의 손에 자신들을 맡길 수도 있습니다! 그들은 어려운 시기에 그들을 보호할 강력한 보호자가 필요합니다...라미레스 장군처럼!"
ARG_Restrict_the_press:0 "언론 제한"
ARG_Restrict_the_press_desc:0 "가짜 뉴스가 언론을 휩쓸고 있고 우리 정부를 향해 대대적인 홍보 활동을 벌이고 있으며, 이는 중단되어야 합니다...물론 국가를 위해서 입니다! 우리는 오직 진실을 그들에게 유리하게 왜곡시키려는 사람들로부터 보호하려 합니다."
ARG_Military_Supremacy:0 "군사 패권"
ARG_Military_Supremacy_desc:0 "우리는 아르헨티나가 패배하지 않을 것이라는 것과 우리의 군대가 세계에서 가장 강한 군대 중 하나라는 것을 세계에 보여 주어야 합니다. 우리는 과거에 유럽을 존경해 왔고, 우리 군대가 그들의 기준에 맞을 때까지 다시 그럴 것입니다."

ARG_Ties_with_Germany:0 "독일과의 관계"
ARG_Ties_with_Germany_desc:0 "우리의 주요 교역 상대국으로서, 독일이 동맹을 맺기 위한 우리의 첫번째 선택이라는 것은 이치에 맞을 뿐입니다. 라미레스는 독일과의 유대를 더욱 공고히 하려하며, 특히 아르헨티나가 수년 간 받아 온 엄청난 양의 독일 이주자들을 고려하면 더욱 그렇습니다, 다른 사람들은 그들의 우려를 표명하고 평화로운 우리 나라를 전쟁에 끌어들일 수 있는 파벌에 동참함으로써 아르헨티나의 중립을 위태롭게 할 수 있다고 주장합니다."

ARG_Five_Year_Plan:0 "제1차 5개년 계획"
ARG_Five_Year_Plan_desc:0 "비록 우리가 영국 수입의 손실에 대처하기 위해 지난 10년간 산업화의 급격한 변화를 강조했지만, 우리 경제는 유럽의 사례와 같지 않습니다. 검은 월요일 위기는 아르헨티나를 20세기로 이끌기 위한 소위 5개년 계획을 승인할 것으로 보이는 취약성을 의회에 보여 주었습니다."
ARG_Reduce_Textile_Reliance:0 "직물에 대한 의존도 감소"
ARG_Reduce_Textile_Reliance_desc:0 "우리는 수십년간 일상적으로 우리의 농산물과 섬유 제품에 의존해 왔지만 다른 나라와의 경쟁은 치열해 졌고, 산업을 보다 현대적인 등가물에 맞추고 경제를 다양화하도록 강요합니다."
ARG_Renegotiate_with_Mitteleuropa:0 "중앙 유럽과의 재협상"
ARG_Renegotiate_with_Mitteleuropa_desc:0 "우리의 교역 상대국들은 어려운 조건을 제시해 왔지만, 우리가 경제를 살리고 싶다면 받아들일 수밖에 없습니다."
ARG_TAMET_Steel:0 "TAMET 강철"
ARG_TAMET_Steel_desc:0 "유럽 철강의 부족은 우리 경제에 심각한 타격을 주고 있고 우리가 전쟁 기계를 계속 가동시키려면 신속한 개입이 필요할 것입니다. 이러한 점을 염두에 두고, 우리는 '야금 작업장(Talleres Metalurgicos)'에 투자하기로 결정했습니다, 그들은 우리에게 강철과 몇몇 지방의 제철소를 더 잘 사용할 수 있는 방법을 제공할 것입니다."
ARG_Parana_Infrastructure_Plan:0 "파라나 사회 기반 시설 계획"
ARG_Parana_Infrastructure_Plan_desc:0 "파라나 강과 우루과이 강은 이 지역의 해상 운송을 방해하고 있으며, 우리가 북부 지방을 추가로 개발하고 도시의 연결을 개선할 수 있도록 하기 위해 제거되어야 합니다."
ARG_Engines_of_War:0 "병기"
ARG_Engines_of_War_desc:0 "전쟁이 아르헨티나로 오고 있고 우리는 준비를 해야 합니다. 망치가 금속을 치고 공장들이 초과 근무를 할 때, 아르헨티나의 전쟁 기계는 어떤 도전에도 맞설 준비가 되어 있는 상태로 모양을 갖추고 있습니다."
ARG_FM_Investement_Program:0 "FM 투자 프로그램"
ARG_FM_Investement_Program_desc:0 "성장하는 우리 군대에 필요한 무기를 더 제공하기 위해, 정부는 '군사 제조업(Fabricaciones Militares)'에 자금을 조달하고, 그들이 필요로 하는 모든 작은 무기들을 우리 군대에 제공할 수 있는 프로그램을 발표했습니다."
ARG_Strive_for_Autarky:0 "경제 자립을 위한 분투"
ARG_Strive_for_Autarky_desc:0 "공장에 전력을 공급하기 위해서 우리는 매우 부족한 철광석, 석탄, 철강이 필요합니다. 하지만 매장량에 대한 소문이 드러났고 우리는 이것들을 뒷받침할 수 있는 가치를 조사하려고 노력하였고, 따라서 더 많은 자급 자족 시스템을 만들기 위해 노력했습니다."
ARG_Export_to_South_America:0 "남미로 수출"
ARG_Export_to_South_America_desc:0 "우리의 농산물과 소비재가 남미 시장에 범람하고 있어 우리나라 경제에 대한 큰 활력과 이웃 국가들의 의존도가 증가하고 있습니다."

ARG_Economic_Reinvigoration_desc:0 "검은 월요일의 불황은 거의 끝나 가고 있는 듯 보이며, 비록 우리 경제가 어려운 상황을 겪고 있지만, 정부의 개입이 그 피해의 가장 큰 부담으로 보입니다."

## Military ##
argmil.10.t:0 "Lack of funding in the Navy"
argmil.10.d:0 "Recent governement adjustements to the military budget have brought our naval spending down to dangerous levels. While this has greatly empowered the military and the developement of new landbased weaponry, officers from the ARA have warned us that further pulling down the budget could have dangerous consequences on the prowess of our fleet."
argmil.10.a:0 "Troubling"

argmil.11.t:0 "Trouble in the Dockyards"
argmil.11.d:0 "Originating from the lack of new governement contracts, some of our dockyards have been forced to close down, firing hundreds of naval workers. Social tensions between the government and the Naval Unions were already high and the recent crisis may have only worsened the relations."
argmil.11.a:0 "Troubling"

argmil.12.t:0 "Explosion in Puerto Belgrano"
argmil.12.d:0 "During a routine inspection of one of our destroyers in the port, an explosion rocked the ship killing dozens of sailors and severly damaging the vessel. While official state propaganda reported the incident as a syndicalist terrorist attack, the real perpetrator is a lack of maintenance of our ever growing fleet and the incapacity of our engineering staff."
argmil.12.a:0 "Troubling"

argmil.13.t:0 "Fighting in Buenos Aires"
argmil.13.d:0 "Increasing aversion between the military branches of our army came to blows last night in Buenos Aires when a group of drunk ARA sailors encountered a military patrol. Arguments surrounding the recent budget cuts for the navy led to a fistfight between the two parties and was quickly followed up by further soldiers joining in. Gendarmería eventually broke up the fights and placed the perpetrators in custody but all help came too late for one of the sailors who died of his injuries 3 hours later in the hospital."
argmil.13.a:0 "Troubling"

argmil.20.t:0 "Lack of funding in the Army"
argmil.20.d:0 "Recent governement adjustements to the military budget have brought our Army spending down to dangerous levels. While this has greatly empowered the ARA and the developement of new war ships, officers from the Army have warned us that further pulling down the budget could have dangerous consequences on the prowess of our land forces and could open us up to foreign invasions."
argmil.20.a:0 "Troubling"

argmil.21.t:0 "Rampant Desertion in the Army"
argmil.21.d:0 "Worsening living standards in the Barracks and lowered wages of our soldiers have caused many to abandon the armed forces and return to their families to support them in the wake of the economic crisis. Military Police and Gendarmería are tasked with tracking down the offendors but have as of now not been able to make a noticeable difference."
argmil.21.a:0 "Troubling"

argmil.22.t:0 "Lack of Military Steel"
argmil.22.d:0 "New orders by the ARA have swallowed up all of our steel reserves and are putting orders for the land forces on the backburner. Tanks, planes and even machine guns have all been forced to lower their production to accomodate the lowered reserves and are making it hard for our army to stay up to date and fully equipped."
argmil.22.a:0 "Troubling"

argmil.23.t:0 "Lack of Skilled Officers"
argmil.23.d:0 "Lowered wages and better prospectives in the ARA have made many of our young potential officers turn away from the land forces and instead follow a career in the Navy. This braindrain of new talent is weighing hard on the aging corps and could potentially impact our capacity to lead our troops against the enemies."

southern.8.a:0 "Most unfortunate!"

southern.61.t:0 "Intervention in the Chilean-Argentinian war?"
southern.61.d:0 "With war roaring its ugly head on our continent once more, the socialist nations of FOP and Chile find themselves pitted against the autocratic regime in Argentina. We have recently seen the virtues of the revolution as well and if we are willing to survive in a world hell bent in destroying socialism, we should assist our Southern brothers before the flame lit by the proletariat is extinguished by the Iron Fist of Argentina."

southern.91.t:0 "Fall of Chile"
southern.91.d:0 "As Argentinian boots march through Santiago while last pockets of resistance throughout the nation are being cleaned up, our nation is forced to give up the fight as well. While some claim that we should continue till the better end, the population has grown weary of war and public opinion is in favour of a quick end to the conflict."

southern.10.t:0 "Fall of Paraguay"

southern.11.t:0 "Argentina refuses to cede Chaco Boreal"

argfor.4.t:0 "Argentina requests Assistance"
argfor.4.d:0 "Locked in an unevitable confrontation with the FOP in Patagonia, Argentina is dedicated to purging the red threat from the continent as quickly as possible. To achieve this, they have come knocking on our door to ask for assistance in the fight as Chile is set to intervene on the behalf of the FOP. This gives us the opportunity to take back the coastline we so desire and put the Chilese in their place. Frictions with Argentina however aren't fully resolved yet and the Yacuiba region could be used an argument should we no longer be an asset to Argentinian Expansion."

argfor.12.d:0 "As their homeland devolves in civil war and thousands die on the streets of the once great American nation for a defunct ideology, swarms of refugees from the States have departed from the East Coast setting sail for our nation. For years we have upheld a policy of open immigration and have actively attracted foreigners. Accepting refugees from the USA however could have unforeseen diplomatic implications and the rate at which they keep flowing in is putting a strain on our nation."
argfor.12.a:0 "Increase fees for entry"
argfor.12.b:0 "Encourage American Immigration"
argfor.12.c:0 "Close the border for American citizens"
 
argfor.13.t:0 "Victory on the Rio Negro!"
argfor.13.d:0 "The northern government now demands that we withdraw from the river after recent border tensions escalated between forces of the Argentinian Army and the FOP militias. Even though we may not have gained any territorial concessions in the struggle, the action has been a great boost to our morale as our people realise that the enemy is not prepared for a full invasion."
argfor.13.a:0 "Onwards to Final Victory!" 
 
argfor.14.t:0 "Argentina offers 'protection'" 
argfor.14.d:0 "As a vulture circles above its dying prey waiting for the right opportunity, so has Argentina closely watched as Brazil underwent major ideological changes. Unfit to protect us any longer and looking to even strike us first and reintegrate our proud nation, Brazil has become too dangerous to be left unopposed. Therefore Argentina has proposed that they protect us from any harm caused by them...at a cost."
argfor.14.a:0 "We have no other choice"
argfor.14.b:0 "We can defend ourselves"

argfor.15.t:0 "Uruguay refuses our proposal!"

argfor.16.t:0 "Military Coup in Argentina!"
argfor.16.d:0 "Continued hesitation to solve the FOP crisis has once again thrown the nation into chaos as military cliques have united to assert control over the nation. Vicious struggles in Buenos Aires, Cordoba and various other cities throughout the nation are still going on but it looks like our governement has once again fallen. Fullfilling their promises of strong and direct leadership, the new military governement has immediately declared war upon the FOP to once and for all end the crisis."

## Black Monday ##
argbla.1.t:0 "Black Monday hits the nation"
argbla.1.d:0 "When the German market opened this morning and the stocks suddenly started plummeting, our nation was one of the first to be hit by the wave. In response to the Berlin stock exchange, the Bolsa de Comercio de Buenos Aires collapsed as well causing even more trouble for Carles who is barely holding on to power."
argbla.1.a:0 "Argentina is thrown into a spiral of bad luck!"

argbla.2.t:0 "Closure of the Bolsa de Comercio?"
argbla.2.d:0 "With stocks continuing to plummet and investors all around the nation panicking, we could close the stock exchange and demand the banks to refuse paying out desperate citizens. This will buy us some more time to fix the disaster while we are focusing on political affairs but will surely not be appreciated by our population."
argbla.2.a:0 "Close it!"
argbla.2.b:0 "The Free Market will fix this!"

argbla.3.t:0 "Close the currency board?"
argbla.3.d:0 "For most of our history, the currency board has tied the Peso to a gold standard where an organ called the Caja de Conversión was tasked with maintaining the value of our currency. With stocks plummeting and Germany taking decisive action to soften the blow, our exports have lost their competitive edge and are going to be struggling to compete with cheap Eastern European and domestic products. Therefore a proposal was offered to close the currency board and abandon the gold standard, letting the peso devaluate and making our products therefore competitive again."
argbla.3.a:0 "Close the board"
argbla.3.b:0 "Keep the board open"

argbla.31.t:0 "Exports are collapsing"
argbla.31.d:0 "Due to increading competition from Europe and other parts of the world, our products have completely lost their competitive edge on the German market causing thousands of our citizens to lose their jobs due to the bankruptcy of many of our major companies."

argbla.4.t:0 "Peso spirals downwards"
argbla.4.d:0 "With political insecurity in Argentina and massive economic troubles in the German Empire, the Peso keeps spiralling downwards forcing many of our old and powerful companies to close down and lay of thousands of workers. Government plans to intervene and save those without jobs are being drafted up but in the meanwhile the situation goes from bad to worse."
argbla.4.a:0 "Strong intervention is a necessity!"

argbla.5.t:0 "Unrest in Cordoba and Mendoza"
argbla.5.d:0 "Caused by the economic recession and feeding of the political insecurity in our nation, thousands of jobless citizens in the industrial cities of Cordoba and Mendoza have flocked to the streets to demand the governement to step in and fix the crisis. Since our control over these cities is still uncontested, local police forces loyal to the army are not intervening on our behalf in an attempt to fan the flames of resistance against Carles and his shaky regime."
argbla.5.a:0 "Send a strongly worded letter"

argbla.6.t:0 "Revising our Exports"
argbla.6.d:0 "After the victory by the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg and the fading importance of the British Empire, Argentina slowly started adjusting itself to the new world order and increased its exports to Germany. This turned out to be the correct choice as 1925 brought with it the collapse of the British Empire and the trade network it had established. As Argentinas prime export partner and the supplier of much of our needed goods, the governement was forced to start a large scale industrialisation program leading to rising social tensions and a couple rough years.\n\n German investements and the increasing importance of our agricultural products turned the situation back around in the thirties, leading to an economic boom and the establishement of Argentina as an economic powerhouse on the continent. The crash of the German market however and the return of protectionism to the nation, have catastrophically impacted our economy and severly hampered our exports. A new trade agreement will have to be signed so we can get a guarantee from the German Empire that they'll keep importing our goods."
argbla.6.a:0 "Send the proposal"

argbla.7.t:0 "Argentinian Trade Delegation"
argbla.7.d:0 "As one of our largest import partners, the struggling republic of Argentina has reached out to our trade ministry begging us to make an exception on the increased tariffs we imposed on non-Mitteleuropan nations. Since their economy is virtually entirely dependent on us, we could put the squeeze on them and try to force them into signing a less favourable agreement.\n\nShould they however take this opportunity to shift their interests to the Entente, it would cut us off from their vital agricultural exports which could give our rivals in the Entente an advantage in the Americas."
argbla.7.a:0 "We need their loyalty!"
argbla.7.b:0 "What's a few extra reichsmarks between friends?"

argbla.71.t:0 "Germany agrees to our terms"

argbla.71.a:0 "We are grateful"

argbla.72.t:0 "Germany imposes harsher terms"
argbla.72.d:0 "Aware of our fragile situation and not willing to drag their own recovery down to assist us, the German trade ministry has demanded we lower the prices of our processed meat exports or face consequences by receiving higher prices on steel, tools and consumer goods.\n\n We are however not obliged to follow these demands and could perhaps strike a deal with the Entente to reduce our dependence on Germany although the Islas Malvinas issue has not fully been resolved yet and could prove to be a British bargaining chip."
argbla.72.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept"
argbla.72.b:0 "Maybe there is an alternative solution..."

argbla.73.t:0 "Argentina comes to bargain"
argbla.73.d:0 "Severly hit by Black Monday and forced by Germany to swallow a tough pill to save their economy, the government has come to us to strike a new trade agreement. Their vast agrarian exports have made them a key player on the global market and years of industrialisation after the fall of our empire have succesfully turned them into a valuable asset for our trade network and possibly alliance.\n\nHowever, they also stole the Falkland Islands in our moment of weakness and this is an insult that doesn't sit well with the public at home. Should we force them to return the islands we would gain a massive amount of support from our followers but could risk an end to possible trade relations with the Republic."

argbla.74.d:0 "Whether it is out of benevolence or a desire to expand their influence on the South American continent, Canada has eagerly agreed to our terms and made an exception for Argentinian products in their trade arrangements, giving us access to a worldwide market of opportunity."
argbla.74.a:0 "We are grateful"

argbla.75.t:0 "Canada demands the Falkland Islands back"
argbla.75.d:0 "While Canada would be willing to revise their broken treaties with us after the 1925 debacle, they have one simple demand before agreeing to discuss possible trade arrangements: The Islas Malvinas have to be returned to British control at once or there will be no possible deal, now or in the future. Not only are the islands an important naval facility in our fight agains the FOP, returning the islands would cause massive outrage on the homefront which we don't need with the already fragile state of our regime.\n\n Inhabitants of the Islands have not been asked whose side they are on but it goes without saying that they have full faith in our capacity to make the right decision."
argbla.75.a:0 "On second thought, the Germans weren't so bad..."
argbla.75.b:0 "Who cares about some sheep rocks anyway?"

argbla.76.t:0 "Argentina accepts our demands!"
argbla.76.d:0 "Realising that they have no other choice but to bow to our demands, the Argentinian governement has officialy signed the new trade agreement granting us even more influence in their nation and improved relations with their trade board. Our steel, consumer goods and other modern appliances will be imported at high prices while we cheaply import their canned food."
argbla.76.a:0 "A great deal"

argbla.8.t:0 "Introduction of the Empréstito patriótico"
argbla.8.d:0 "As our recovery attempts have only proven mildly succesfull and the economy is still failing, the governement has announced the 'empréstito patriótico' or patriotic loan to strenghten the coffers. The first of these new tariffs is to be imposed on gasoline with the profits being directed to the Dirección Nacional de Vialidad, or the National Office of Public Highways."

argbla.9.t:0 "Creation of La Junta Nacional de Granos"
argbla.9.d:0 "Operating as our National Grain Board, the JNG will buy wheat, flax and corn from our struggling farmers for prices established by our governement. Through this panel we can secure a fair price for our farmers while backing them up when we are again hit by a recession using the means of the  Exchange Fund of the Banco de la Nación. \n\n Some in the governement however would prefer expanding the panel drastically and also secure prices for Industrial and all Agrarian goods. Liberals however see this as a direct attack on the Free Market and are urging the governement to stop with these policies before it is too late."
argbla.9.a:0 "The Board will regulate all goods!"

argbla.9.c:0 "Block the Proposal!" 

argbla.10.t:0 "Stabilisation in the Countryside"
argbla.10.d:0 "Due to our decisive actions in the early days of the recession and primarily due to the successes of the JNG, a large portion of our farmers has been able to escape from bankruptcy. Now that trade is once again increasing, our farms are in excellent shapes and large shipements of food are already being sent to Canada and the German Empire."

argbla.12.d:0 "Founded on August 10 1912 under the administration of Roque Sáenz Peña, the Military Aviation School was created to accomodate the rising importance of aviation and to train and subsidize Argentinas first generation of pilots. Due to the ever increasing importance of aviation and its introduction in military warfare during the Weltkrieg, expansions were agreed upon in 1934 to build a new headquarters for our aeronautical school. Located on the outskirts of Cordoba, the school is destined to educate the next generation of pilots and give us an edge over our neighbours."

argbla.13.t:0 "Buenos Aires Underground Expands!"
argbla.13.d:0 "Originally opened in 1913, the Buenos Aires underground was the metro system on the South American continent and even the entire Southern Hemisphere. Under a near monopoly of the AATC, little expansion was done in the last decades prompting the governement to step in and transfer construction rights to the Compañía Hispano–Argentina de Obras Públicas y Finanzas (CHADOPYF). They went on to create a new line for the system, the Line D connecting Catedral to Tribunales.\n\n Continued emigration to the city from the impouverished countryside and the massive influx of European immigrants has left our public transportation system severly lacking which has led to the government proposal to nationalise the network into the Transport Corporation of Buenos Aires (CTCBA) to allow for better expansion and to meet the demands created by the population explosion of the city."

Club's first ground had been located in Dársena Sur of the old Buenos Aires port (currently Puerto Madero) and Isla Demarchi before moving to Brandsen and Del Crucero streets in 1924.\n\n In 1931, the Boca Juniors' steering committee (led by president Ruperto Molfino) acquired the lands from the Municipality of Buenos Aires for A$ 2,200,000. Three years later the club published a call for tenders to built its new stadium. Economic hardship due to the Black Monday disaster and the inablility to find proper architects delayed the construction of the new stadion until 1938 when the club played their last match before the great work began.\n\n Finally opening on May 25, 1940, with a friendly match between Boca and San Lorenzo, the home side won 2-0 with both goals scored by Ricardo Alarcón. Even though the station was freshly built, it lacked a lighting system which forced the game to end by the 70th minute."

## 1936 Carles ##
argcar.1.t:0 "Status of Argentina"
argcar.1.d:0 "By the early 20th century, Argentina was enjoying a booming and fast growing economic prowess based on its meat and cereal exports. Immigrants from all over Europe flooded towards the Republic and vigorous entrepreneurship and a nascent industry quickly propelled Argentina forwards as one of the most prosperous nations on the planet. Trade relations were secure and exports to the United Kingdom and Germany kept increasing. \n\n When the Weltkrieg however struck, Argentina was forced into neutrality unwilling to side with either its most important economic ally, the UK, or its second most important one, Germany. By steering between the two, sanctions were brought down by the British, enforcing an embargo on trade with Germany. While Argentina tried circumventing this by selling through third countries, the sales were not the same and the pre-WK miracle slowed down. \n\n As the last years of the Weltkrieg approached, it became apparent to the UK that it was fighting a losing fight and ordered the Argentinian government and companies to ramp up production and exploit the nation to the fullest. Discontent with the increased demands and sick of British exploitation, the workers started to organise, protest and finally rise up in an armed revolt. Unable to fully contain the situation, the control of the Argentine government on the uprisings went from bad to worse and by the mid 20s Argentina had lost control of Santa Cruz, Chubut and Rio Negro Provinces to the newly formed Frente Obrero Patagonico. \n\n Three subsequent democratically elected governments were tasked with solving the crisis but failed one after another. In response to their incapacity to rule, General Uriburu rose up in 1930 to attempt crushing the revolt. A reign of terror spread across the nation with socialist and syndicalist sympathisers massacred and pushed southwards. His dictatorship is however short lived as he dies from cancer two years later, forming a power vacuum and once more no large scale intervention in the South."
argcar.1.a:0 "Very well"

argcar.100.d:0 "Elections are written out and through electoral fraud, the PAN under Roca successfully takes power, prompting a slow recovery from Uriburu's dictatorship and a changing attitude towards the FOP. Small skirmishes into FOP territory are launched and the navy successfully retakes the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego. Intervention from Chile however stops the government from achieving victory and temporarily ends conflict with the FOP.  \n\n When in 1935 rumours start surfacing that Roca may be attempting to end the conflict and leave the FOP alone, outrage across the nation erupts, enabling the Liga Patriotica under Manuel Carles to gain the support they need culminating into the Christmas Coup. Supported by the Navy and various military elements, Carles coups the government on Christmas 1935, takes control over the Capital Region and starts solidifying his hold on the nation. \n\n As the first of January 1936 overtakes the nation, Carles is still in the midst of his attempted coup with success far from certain. Asides from the Buenos Aires capital region and small inland provinces, his control is nihil. Support from the ARA or 'Argentinian Armada' is guaranteed but many of the military commanders in the Army doubt Carles’ potential and are organising to put down his coup."

argcar.2.t:0 "Clashes at the Colegio Militar de la Nación"
argcar.2.d:0 "As one of the last strongholds in the greater Buenos Aires region, the Colegio Militar de la Nación was occupied by loyalist members of the military who had barricaded themselves inside the compound awaiting reinforcements from the interior. In response to this last ditch effort, soldiers of the ARA were sent in to try and push them out. While small clashes occured throughout the compound, the Army surrendered a week later when their basic utilities and will to hold out had started to fade. \n \n Amongst the captured were a few notable Army commanders but it seems that the majority of the Staff had fled the city during the first days of the Coup. This victory may be insignificant in the greater picture but we now firmly control the entirety of Buenos Aires."

Most of the Northern railroads however pass through Rosario, which has not yet declared its allegiance to Carles and may prove a torn in our side during the Northern campaign. Our troops are currently finishing up the loyalist remnants in the Estación Retiro in Buenos Aires but we will have to decide whether we have the ARA secure the coastline and its populous cities or the Rosario hub first."

argcar.4.t:0 "Gendarmería Nacional Argentina"
argcar.4.d:0 "With questionable support from the army and the limited manpower of the ARA, debate has arisen about the capabilities of our internal strike force. According to the Argentine Constitution, the armed forces can technically not intervene in internal civil conflicts, so the Gendarmerie would be created as an organ subordinate to the Defense Ministry and thus the Carles cabinet. It would be defined as a civilian "security force of a military nature" and maintain a functional relationship with the Ministry of Defense, as part of both the National Defense System and the Interior Security System. It would therefore maintain capabilities arising from the demands required by joint military planning with the armed forces and and would legally be able to intervene in the current crisis.\n\n Our funds are however limited at this time and the loyalty of the new recruits would be questionable at best which has made Carles reconsider the proposal to avoid the possibility of a countercoup from within his own ranks."

The subsequent seperatism in Patagonia and the continued corruption and shady dealings of the conservative ruling party however have stumped our progress and kept the old system alive and triving. Not only has this led to great disgruntlement amongst the people, it has created a hotbed for Carles supporters who claim the High Court is obstructing "populist will". \n \n With Carles and his supporters now in control of the High Court, it has given him the perfect opportunity to strike the defunct system by relieving all 5 members of the Court from their duties and to replace them by his "men of the people". We can however further push our narrative and start replacing the lower courts as well with our followers although this might backfire greatly should the people turn sides."

While this doesn't come as a surprise, we hadn't expected the protests to rise up this quickly which puts a serious dent in the plans to secure the Argentinian hinterland and could potentially buy the conservative forces the time they need to form an organised opposition."

Especially the station of San Nicolas was hit hard and has caused much of our planned movements to become impossible to achieve. The fall of momentum in our movement and the rising threat of an organised military opposition to Carles, has forced us to reconsider other options. The Grupo de Oficiales Unidos holds vast control over the Army and has not yet chosen whom to side with which could make them a valuable asset in our struggle.

The Panzers that were brought in from Buenos Aires to support the assailants proved to be ineffective in the small streets of the city and skirmishes in the Villa Diego and Saladillo quickly became disasters for the attackers. By the end of the 10-day struggle for the city, supplies and morale of the Carles forces ran out and the commanding officer formally surrendered to the GOU effectively ending the fight for Rosario and by extension the campaign to pacifiy the hinterlands."

Being allied to Carles during the early days of his regime, the GOU has politely requested Carles to tone down his recklesness before he drags Argentina down with him. Controlling vast parts of our armed forces, we cannot risk angering the GOU as they could lift us from power just as easily as they helped us seize it so we will either have to bow to their request and stop with the campaign or take the radical approach of removing the organisation from power with force."

Organised by members of the GOU, General Ramírez took up the lead of the coup, quickly organising their forces to seize key locations in the city before Carles could react. With the majority of the loyalist soldiers on the borders planning the next offensive, little to no troops were left in the Buenos Aires region leading to a quick and decisive strike on governement facilities. Upon arriving at the Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics in the neighborhood of Núñez, the group was attacked by loyal forces who were entrenched there, resulting in the death of 30 and the wounding of 100 but ultimately the surrender of the ARA forces. \n\n Having surrendered the Navy School of Mechanics, the remaining Argentinian generals received the rebel leaders and declared Ramírez president of the Republic by noon. Carles, while able to escape the rebels troops, boarded a small fishing trawler and set off to Peru in the hopes of finding an ally in their regime."

While we have temporarily granted his request while we await the return of stability to Argentina, President Ramírez has now demanded his immediate extradition so he can be persecuted for his crimes. Carles has always been a strong ally of our Peruvian governement and it is as of now still unclear whether Ramírez will follow the same foreign policy although sending Carles back could secure good relations with the new regime."

argcar.26.d:0 "Unwilling to comply with our demands to extradite Carles, the Peruvian governement has decided to grant him full political asylum. Ramírez has answered with the forced expulsion of Peruvian diplomats from Buenos Aires and has threathened Peru with economic sanctions should they not comply with our demands. Many experts believe that Peru will cave in to this response quickly based on the built up Chilean war friendship and the reliance on Argentinian exports but others see this as a chance for Peru to prove that it can stand on its own against foreign aggression."

Centered mostly around the railroads and having experienced a split due to the conflict in the FOP, the CGT has slowly started to establish itself as the largest union of our nation. \n\nWith their dissolution, the socialists once again lose an important pillar of their power. The more than 100.000 members of the organisation though are sure to organise resistance and with the already rising tensions between the unions and the governement due to the Black Monday disaster, this move could be very dangerous to the stability of our nation."

By a decisive action by the government, the National University of the Littoral was seized and Jordán Bruno Genta instated as supervisor. Genta, known for his far-right and anti-reformist ideas, maintains that the country needs to create “an intelligent aristocracy, nourished by Roman and Hispanic lineage” to lead the nation to greatness. \n\nThe University Federation of the Littoral responded vehemently against the appointment of Genta calling it a violation of the 1918 university act which guaranteed governing autonomy and academic freedom. Government forces immediately responded to these accusation by detaining its secretary general and expelling students and professors who protested in opposition. "

The management of the meat industry refused these terms and in response a general strike was called throughout the nation paralysing the vital sector. Gendarmería had been sent in to quell the strikers and force them back to work but clashes between government forces and protestors quickly escalated, leading to hard oppression by the police forces and the arrestation of dozens of strikers. \n\n Personal intervention however by Perón has made the Unions and management come to a fragile agreement followed by the release of Peter to calm the masses down. Part of these negotiations however led to the new Autonomous Butcher’s Union of Berisso and Ensenada, in open opposition to the FOIC."

With this action, the Union has been near completely destroyed. Lack of funds, the loss of their leadership and the planned deportation of their leader Peter have made the organisation dissolve giving room to new unions, preferably ours, to expand and take their territorium."

argcar.36.d:0 "Even though the Unions have been legalised now by Ramírez, a clausule was included which lets the government take over any union at will. The powerful railroad union, which formed the foundation of the CGT was the first to fall under this new policy and has been placed under direct government control. A so called "inventor" has been placed in the organisation as supervisor but is more a direct extension of the government than an independent agent.\n\n Strikes against this move almost immediately followed but were put down hard by the gendarmaria whom have arrested dozens more influential socialist leaders. The Unions however have started to change direction sensing that the new government is heavily anti-unions and therefore a group under Ángel Borlenghi has approached Colonel Domingo Mercante to sit down and come to a peaceful resolution."
argcar.36.a:0 "Mercante accepts the offer"

argcar.37.t:0 "Mercante and the Unions reach an accord"
argcar.37.d:0 "Represented by Ángel Borlenghi, Francisco Pablo Capozzi and Juan Atilio Bramuglia, the Unions opted, albeit with reservations and distrust, to establish relations with a sector of the military government more inclined to accept union demands, with the aim of forming an alliance capable of influencing the course of events. To achieve initial contact with the military they chose Colonel Domingo Mercante, the son of an important railroad union leader and member of the GOU, to represent the government and hopefully persuade him to listen to the Unions. In turn, Mercante summoned his political partner and close friend, Juan Perón, a colonel and member of the GOU. \n\n While the negotiations were tough, the proposal of the Unions that the military created a Secretariat of Labor, strengthen a now loyal CGT, and sanction a series of labor laws that would accept the historical claims of the Argentine labor movement was positively recieved by the colonels. They however demanded the immediate release of Peter, who was imprisoned earlier this year when the army rolled up the FOIC."

argcar.38.t:0 "Secretary of Labour Perón"
argcar.38.d:0 "After his sucess to broker a deal between the unions and the military government, Perón was granted the office of Head of the Department of Labor. A completely empty position with no power, we hoped this would keep the ambitious colonel busy and blocked from further rise in politics. He however succesfully fullfilled the office and even gave it a new meaning by approving the labour laws that had been claimed historically by the Argentine labor movement (extending the severance indemnity that existed since 1934 for commerce employees, pensions for commerce employees, a multi-clinic hospital for railway workers, technical schools for workers, the prohibition of employment agencies, the creation of the labor courts, Christmas bonuses), lending efficacy to the existing labor inspectors and impelling for the first time collective bargaining, which grew to become the basic way of regulating the relationship between capital and labor. Moreover he forced us to drop the decree regarding unions associations sanctioned by president Ramírez in the first weeks of the revolution, which was criticized by the entire labor movement. \n\nIn addition, Perón, Mercante, and the initial group of unionists who formed the alliance began to organize a new union that would assume a nationalist-labor identity. The group assumed an anti-syndicalist position already existing in parts of the old CGT and, relying on the power of the Secretary of Labor, organized new unions in the industries which lacked them (chemicals, electricity, tobacco) and set up rival unions in industries with powerful old and hostile to the governement, unions (meat, construction, textiles, metallurgy)."

Ramírez, unwilling to back down now and risk the anger of German diplomats has not yet taken a decision but must do so quickly if he wishes to remain in power.

An unfamiliar social class, which had remained completely absent from Argentine history until then, burst into Buenos Aires and demanded Perón's freedom. The city was taken by tens of thousands of workers from the industrial areas that had been growing on the outskirts of the city. The crowd set itself up in the Plaza de Mayo and refused to leave until their demands were met. It was characterized by the large number of young people and especially women who were part of it, and by the predominance of people with hair and skin darker than those who attended the traditional political acts of the time. The anti-Peronist opposition stressed these difference, referring to them in derogatory terms such as “blacks”, “fat people”, “ descamisados (shirtless)”, “cabecitas negras”. It was the Radical Unionist leader Sammartino who even went so far as to call the event a “zoo flood”.\n\n The protestors were accompanied by a whole new generation of young people and new union delegates belonging to the unions of the CGT, which had responded to a sugar workers’ strike two days earlier. It was a completely peaceful demonstration, but the political and cultural upheaval was of such heft that, in a few hours, the triumph of the anti-Peronist movement had been cancelled out, as did the remaining power of the military government. \n\n After intense negotiations the radical Armando Antille distinguished himself as Perón's delegate leading to his liberation. That same night Peron addressed his sympathizers from a balcony at the Casa Rosada and praised their dedication and patriotism."
